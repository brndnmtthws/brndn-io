We are all artists, in one sense or another. Our society, unfortunately, does little
to cultivate this innate creativity beyond the occasional obligatory art class in
school. I dabble in creative pursuits myself, though I don't identify as particularly
talented or skilled in making art. Yet I still create, because the act itself
brings its own rewards.

When examining the animal kingdom, artistic expression emerges as one of the few
characteristics that differentiate humans from other species. This isn't to suggest
other animals don't create art–they absolutely do–but rather that humans have
developed a more complex relationship with artistic expression. We can analyze,
critique, and deliberately evolve our art in ways other species cannot, though
evidence suggests many animals still appreciate and create their own forms of art.

Consider the bowerbird, who creates elaborate, decorated structures purely to
attract mates. These constructions serve no practical purpose beyond aesthetic
appeal–they're not nests or shelters, just artistic displays. Or examine how
certain species have evolved spectacular visual displays through bright colors
and intricate patterns. These evolutionary art pieces serve dual purposes: attracting
mates and deterring predators. Sexual dimorphism represents nature's own artistic
evolution spanning millions of years, demonstrating how art functions as an essential
survival mechanism.

What's particularly fascinating about animal art–bird songs, elaborate dances,
visual displays–is how they often resonate with humans despite not being created
for our appreciation. We find beauty in a nightingale's melody, though it sings
not for us. We marvel at a peacock's magnificent tail, though it displays not for
our benefit. We admire the geometric precision of a spider's web, though it weaves
without human audience in mind. This cross-species appreciation suggests an underlying,
perhaps universal, connection between living beings and artistic expression that
transcends mere survival utility.

Music stands as perhaps humanity's most universally consumed art form, though we
don't always categorize it alongside paintings or sculptures in our conception of
"art." Music communicates emotions, perspectives, narratives, and concepts with
remarkable efficiency. It bridges generational and cultural divides, creating
communal experiences in ways few other mediums can achieve. Music has accompanied
human civilization since our earliest days and will likely remain with us throughout
our existence as a species.

Despite art's fundamental importance to human experience, few people receive guidance
in appreciating art, and even fewer learn how to create it beyond rudimentary
instruction in childhood. This represents a significant cultural oversight, as
artistic creation offers profound benefits: self-expression, self-knowledge,
interpersonal connection, and conceptual exploration.

Learning to appreciate art requires no specialized training–simply identifying
what resonates with you personally, what doesn't, and allowing yourself time to
engage with what you enjoy. Quality in art is ultimately subjective; it's whatever
speaks to you, regardless of critics or self-proclaimed experts. Though some may
attempt to gatekeep artistic appreciation behind walls of academic jargon or
historical context, art fundamentally belongs to everyone.

We all possess creative capacity, though many haven't yet discovered their preferred
medium or granted themselves permission to explore artistic interests. Some find
their expression through cooking, gardening, or arranging their living spaces.
Others through writing, singing, dancing, or digital creation. The medium matters
less than the act of creation itself.

So today, make something–anything. Write a poem. Sketch a tree. Compose a melody.
Arrange flowers in a vase. The quality doesn't matter; the act of creation does.
Your art might never hang in galleries or sell for millions, but that was never
the point. Make art because it connects you to that ancient, fundamental aspect
of being human that we share with the dancing birds and singing whales–the drive
to create something that wasn't there before.
