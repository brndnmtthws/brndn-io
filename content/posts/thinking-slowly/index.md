In Daniel Kahneman's book pop psychology book _Thinking, Fast and Slow_, he
describes the human brain as having 2 systems for thought: a fast system, which
responds quickly to stimuli, and a slow system, which tends to produce
more..._thoughtful_thoughts.

This book was all the rage amongst thought leaders around 2011 when it was
published, so if you missed out on it, don't worry, [Wikipedia has a
tl;dr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow) that tells you
all you need to know.

It's actually a great book, I do recommend reading it if that's up your alley.
It's been a few years since I read it, but I do want to talk about slow
thinking, or "system 2" as Daniel calls it. The book is also an excellent intro
to cognitive biases and how to overcome some of the worst ones.

System 2 is the analytical/rational conscious system, as opposed to system 1
which is the emotional, unconscious system. And somewhere in between both of
those is what people refer to as _gut instinct_, which tends to present as a
feeling or emotion.

Your gut instinct, or intuition, is often incredibly good at providing signals.
However, you need to be careful not to mix up your gut with system 1, which is
probably the _worst_ source of brain thoughts.

In any case, society tends to over value system 1. Thought leaders tend to
emphasize being "high energy", but what they're really describing are people
who run on system 1 most of the time. Running on system 1 might make you appear
as someone who has genius or insight because you manage to arrive at decision
quickly, but in reality you're execising the fewest brain cells possible to
produce results.

As individuals, we should strike for operating on system 2. The easiest way to
make sure we use system 2 over 1 is to slow the F down. This is especially true
of any kind of important decision. Before making any kind of big purchase or
signing any kind of contract, you should (at the very least) sleep on it, and
give your brain some time to consider the problem. Even if you still make the
wrong decision, at least you won't regret not giving yourself some time to
consider it.

That also presents another decent rule of life: if you're being pressured into
making a decision on the spot, then the answer should be no. This is a common
sales tactic that appeals to system 1, your emotional and animal instincts. It
works because system 1 is not very good at decision making.

I doubt that society is going to change and suddenly start valuing introverts
and slow thinkers the way we value extroverts and impulsive psychopaths, but
individuals can always make the choice to rely on system 2 instead of 1.

Often the _right_ decision is the _hard_ decision. System 1 tends to go for
easy decisions, and instant gratification, because it's responding
automatically to whatever stimuli will produce a bit of dopomine.
