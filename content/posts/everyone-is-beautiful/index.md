There's a subreddit called r/amiugly where people post pictures of themselves and ask the community to rate their appearance. It's a place where people seek validation, reassurance that they are beautiful, or at least not ugly.

After spending time on this subreddit, I've noticed something striking: most people posting aren't ugly at all. They're generally normal-looking individuals who skew young and presumably struggle with low self-esteem. It's a fascinating window into the minds of people who are deeply insecure about their appearance despite—in most cases—having nothing to worry about.

## The Mirror's Harsh Gaze

We are our own worst critics. We stare at ourselves in the mirror daily, fixating on perceived flaws rather than strengths. We compare our unfiltered reality to others' highlight reels and feel inadequate. We see every imperfection in ourselves while missing our own beauty.

This self-criticism is amplified by our exposure to unrealistic beauty standards in magazines, movies, and social media. These images rarely reflect reality—they're highly modified, perfectly lit, professionally styled, and extensively edited. This type of photography isn't authentic; its purpose is to sell products or project an idealized image rather than capture a person's true essence.

Authenticity, however, is genuinely beautiful. When people express their true selves, flaws and all, it demonstrates self-confidence and self-acceptance. Displaying imperfections shows comfort in your own skin—a sign of strength, not weakness.

I believe most everyone has beauty. Personally, I find the polished photography in advertisements and Instagram often off-putting. I'm drawn to candid, unposed, unedited photos that capture real people in real moments.

## The Magic Behind the Lens

A skilled photographer with the right eye can make anyone look remarkable with proper lighting and technique. Conversely, poor photography can make even conventionally beautiful people look unflattering.

Reading comments on r/amiugly reveals that most responses are positive and supportive. People are generally kind, yet we tend to fixate on negative comments, particularly from trolls. Sometimes we dismiss genuine compliments as insincere or biased, unable to accept the positive feedback.

Beauty is subjective—what appeals to one person may not appeal to another. And outward appearances are only one aspect of beauty. I've met people who look stunning in photos but reveal inner ugliness through their words and actions. Focusing solely on superficial beauty is shallow and ultimately unfulfilling.

## Everyone's Best Angle

In my years photographing people, I've discovered everyone has their best angles, expressions, and moments. With the right approach, everyone can be captured beautifully.

Remember that comparison is the thief of joy. The people you see in advertisements or on Instagram represent a carefully curated and edited version of reality. Even those seemingly perfect individuals have bad days, insecurities, and flaws.
