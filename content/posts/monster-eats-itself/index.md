Yesterday an interesting thing happened, where disenfranchised folks walked right up into the US capitol after Donald Trump told them to do so. They weren't welcome there, and a few people ended up dead in the scuffles, and a lot of people were mad for a variety of reasons.

There were a few really interesting things that happened in the aftermath which I felt like writing about. Or rather, there were things that _didn't_ happen. Things people _weren't_ saying spoke more about the problem than what they were saying.

I was watching the politicians give their self congratulatory speeches live on C-SPAN after the whole thing was resolved, and I couldn't help but notice how absurd the whole thing seemed. 

## Failure to acknowledge systemic failure

I think the most important theme from yesterday was the complete rejection of
the idea that the US government itself is a failure. It's easy to blame Trump
or whotever, but none of the politicians are willing to acknowledge the
(obvious to me) fact that the US is a failed state.

When you have more than 70 million people voting to elect someone who is
clearly unfit to be in charge of a nuclear arsenal, I think it's evidence
that the system doesn't work.

Trump is a symptom, not the cause.

## Labelling them as "a mob", "rioters", "terrorists", etc

I get that what they did wasn't right, but in a way I am sympathetic.
Politicians have long enjoyed zero repurcussions (including Trump), and it's
about time they get a reminder of who they actually work for. Hint: it's not
themselves.

There are so many massive problems in the US, and it affects the entire
world. Why does the US get a free pass? Why are politicians never held
accountable?

## Zero talk of political reform

My opinion is that the US constitution is dated, ineffective, and needs
intensive reform. It's a document that was crafted more than 200 years ago,
in a very different time, and one which still has glaring problems. All the
politicians and so-called "patriots" love to shout to the rooftops about how
great the constitution is, but all I see is an insanely convoluted, complex,
and undemocratic system that doesn't work anymore.

The US constitution hasn't been meaningfully reformed since 1971, when the
last real constitutional amendment was proposed. A functioning government
should be updating itself with the latest firmware as needed, and it is
_damn_ needed right now.

Here are some ideas of what should happen very quickly to fix the government:

 - eliminate the electoral college and the whole circus surrounding it
 - standardize voting practices
 - ban gerrymandering
 - switch to ranked-choice voting
 - implement proportional representation
 - curb presidential powersâ€“or better yet, eliminate the position outright
 - increase the total number of politicians in the government to provide better representation of diverse groups
 - introduce direct democracy reforms to allow people to vote directly on large issues
 - hold politicians accountable to their constituents by measuring their voting in government to how their constituents vote on issues

## Fewer speeches, less bullshit, more action

Watching the politicians talk about how great they are was exhausting, and I
couldn't help but notice all the other politicians in the background who
weren't even listening to each other. They were all just sitting there
playing on their phones, scrolling through Twitter or Instagram, fidgeting
with their pens and paper. None of them actually listen to each other:
they're just there to get their 5 minutes of fame and get out. They don't
actually care about "working together" or any of those other vapid tropes.

The best thing we can do, to avoid complete collapse, is to limit the amount
of influence any one politician has on the 300+ million people living in the
USA.
