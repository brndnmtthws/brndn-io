Sometimes we do things because we want to, sometimes we do things because we must. You might tackle that tedious spreadsheet at work not because you love Excel, but because it's your responsibility. Or you might blast that 80s power ballad for the twentieth time simply because it brings you joy. Simple enough, right?

## The Rise of Performative Living

But there's a third category that has exploded in recent years: things people do primarily to be seen doing them by strangers on the internet. This peculiar mode of existence—what I call "performative existing"—has become increasingly common. Picture someone who has zero interest in art spending three hours at MoMA, methodically documenting their presence with strategic selfies for Instagram rather than engaging with any actual artwork.

In a world before social platforms, if you disliked museums, you simply wouldn't go. Today, millions engage in experiences they don't genuinely enjoy because they're performing for an invisible audience. They've become the reluctant stars of their own reality shows, compelled to maintain a carefully curated public narrative.

## Questioning Our Motivations

I've been reflecting on this phenomenon lately—specifically how much of what we do stems from internal desire versus external validation. Are you taking that beach vacation because you crave the ocean air, or because tropical backdrops generate more engagement? Are you reading that bestseller because the story captivates you, or because displaying intellectual curiosity boosts your personal brand? Are you wearing those uncomfortable shoes because they match your style, or because they signal status?

The line between authentic action and performance has blurred dramatically. Studies show the average person spends 147 minutes daily on social media[^1], with much of that time consumed by viewing or creating content that showcases idealized versions of everyday life.

We all navigate this spectrum. Sometimes we make choices to please parents, impress friends, or shape others' perceptions. That's human nature. But I've found value in regularly asking myself a simple question: Am I doing this because I genuinely want to, or because I'm preoccupied with how it makes me appear to others?

## Finding Authenticity in Writing

Take this blog, for example. I write because the process itself brings satisfaction. I appreciate that some people enjoy reading my thoughts, but I'm not obsessed with maximizing readership. I write from internal motivation rather than external obligation. The act itself provides fulfillment independent of being recognized as "a writer." I don't even track visitor statistics.

While I'm aware of potential judgment, I strive to preserve my natural thought processes without excessive filtering. I aim for candor and openness rather than calculated self-presentation. I'm not playing 4D chess to manipulate impressions or burnish my image. Some of what I write will inevitably fall flat—and that's perfectly fine. As Ted Williams once said, "Baseball is the only field of endeavor where a man can succeed three times out of ten and be considered a good performer."

## The Value of Intention

That said, let's avoid congratulating ourselves simply for recognizing these patterns. The real challenge lies in consistently examining why we're doing something, who benefits from our actions, and whether the activity holds inherent value beyond its social currency.

Those museum selfies might generate a brief dopamine hit when likes roll in, but research shows that external validation provides diminishing returns on happiness. A week later, no one remembers the post—except perhaps the algorithms that monetized your attention and the platforms that converted your performance into advertising revenue.

In a world where the average person spends over two hours daily on social media[^1], perhaps the most radical act is doing something solely for yourself, with no documentation and no audience. The experiences we cherish most deeply are often those we never shared online.
