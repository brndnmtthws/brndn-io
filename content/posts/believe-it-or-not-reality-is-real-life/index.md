In the bygone era, we had résumés—and today, many of us still maintain these professional
summaries (or curriculum vitae, for the academically inclined). But now we also curate
digital identities through social profiles that serve as our new first impressions
in an increasingly online world. For the professionally ambitious, these digital personas
have become the initial point of contact, the gateway through which career opportunities
flow. In the context of employment, these digital breadcrumbs form a constellation
that hiring managers use to make judgments about your candidacy long before any interview.
Best hope those recruiters don't unearth your anonymous Reddit alter ego.

Here's the uncomfortable truth: your LinkedIn profile doesn't represent reality.
Neither do traditional résumés, for that matter. Both are carefully curated projections—blank
canvases verified by essentially no one, where you can paint whatever professional
portrait serves your purposes. The boundary between strategic self-presentation and
outright fabrication remains blurry, maintained only by the possibility that someone
might eventually ask you to demonstrate that expertise you claimed or check with the
references you provided.

Over the years, I've encountered numerous self-proclaimed Thought Leaders of the
Internet—individuals who command impressive followings on various platforms—who, in
unfiltered reality, struggle with basic productivity. Their daily accomplishment
often amounts to little beyond scrolling their feeds with increasing dissociation.
They aren't the authorities they project themselves to be, or perhaps they grapple
with unaddressed challenges like anxiety or attention disorders. Whatever the case,
their actual professional output reveals the carefully constructed online persona as
precisely that—a construction.

Since deliberately deleting my LinkedIn profile, my attempts to secure employment with
health benefits have occasionally encountered baffled recruiters who cannot comprehend
my disinterest in irrelevant outreach, collecting superficial professional connections,
or witnessing the latest performative posts from what Reddit aptly describes as
[LinkedIn Lunatics](https://old.reddit.com/r/LinkedInLunatics/).

I had accumulated hundreds of LinkedIn "connections" over the years, but can recall
meaningful interactions with remarkably few. I've maintained contact with anyone
worth knowing through fundamentally human channels—primarily email and phone
communications—without requiring algorithmic intermediation of these relationships.

## The Pragmatic Case for Keeping LinkedIn

Despite my personal stance, I recognize that most people should likely maintain their
LinkedIn profiles. We inhabit a professional landscape where deviating from established
norms creates unnecessary friction in the employment process. I enjoy the privilege
of financial independence that allows me to exist without conventional employment,
affording me the luxury of opting out of these systems. Most working professionals
don't share this privilege, and I understand that reality.

Nevertheless, I find it profoundly strange that we've arrived at a point where
professional judgment hinges partly on one's willingness to participate in what is,
fundamentally, an advertising delivery mechanism dressed in professional networking
attire. My personal aversion to advertisement in all forms makes this particularly
distasteful.

But I digress. The central point remains: your LinkedIn profile exists as a professional
fiction—one you author and curate. This fiction can certainly advance your career
objectives when deployed strategically. But it isn't reality. Reality consists of
your actual capabilities, experiences, and behaviors when not performing for digital
audiences. Real life encompasses what you do between social media posts, during moments
when you're not optimizing for external validation. It's the mundane weekday moments
between your carefully photographed vacations. Whether examining LinkedIn, dating
profiles, Instagram highlights, or Twitter feeds, we're witnessing carefully edited
self-projections, not unfiltered reality.

I'll refrain from rendering absolute judgments about whether these platforms deserve
your participation (though my personal choice is clear). Certain exceptions exist—I
maintain appreciation for GitHub, which some might classify as a social platform, though
its utility transcends social validation.

## Digital Authenticity and Human Connection

As fundamentally social creatures, we naturally seek belonging, approval, and community
alignment. My personal preference, however, gravitates toward unmediated experiences—walking
through parks, immersing in music, reading books (primarily audiobooks these days),
developing personal projects, and writing. I maintain peripheral awareness of current
events and still browse old Reddit in read-only mode, while consciously avoiding the
negativity vortex that characterizes much online discourse.

Do you genuinely need a profile on any particular platform? Not intrinsically. Will
having a LinkedIn presence simplify your job search? Almost certainly. Will prospective
dates feel more comfortable meeting someone whose Instagram provides social proof of
normal human activities? Probably. But are these digital presences necessary components
of a meaningful life? Absolutely not.

To those hesitating at the digital crossroads, concerned about missing opportunities
or feeling the gravitational pull of scrolling addiction, I offer this encouragement:
consider deleting that account. The initial withdrawal may feel uncomfortable, but
you'll likely discover yourself more present, productive, and authentically engaged
with your actual life rather than its digital simulacrum.

The irony doesn't escape me—writing about digital authenticity on a blog that itself
represents a curated perspective. Yet perhaps that's precisely the point. Our digital
and physical lives aren't entirely separate realities but rather different expressions
of the same complex human experience. The question isn't whether to have an online
presence, but rather how consciously we choose to shape it, how authentically it reflects
our actual selves, and most importantly, how much of our finite attention we surrender
to its maintenance.
