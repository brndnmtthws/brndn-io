If you pay much attention to the mainstream media, you've likely heard the
phrase "energy transition" thrown around, which alludes to an ongoing global
effort to transition away from fossil fuels and move toward so-called "green"
energy sources[^1]. As much airtime as this catch-phrase gets, there's little
evidence to support any transition[^2].

The [Kyoto protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol) was adopted
in 1997, and as you can see below it had little to no effect on pollution, as
you can see in the measurements of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere. It does not
take a gifted mind to see the problem, any five-year-old child could tell you
we're going in the wrong direction (and that same child today will pay the
price in the future).

Other climate treaties have come along since 1997, and none of them have had a
measurable impact on reducing pollution. No matter how much CEOs try to tell us
they're doing everything they can to reduce pollution, at the end of the day the
data shows that we keep extracting more fossil fuels every year, and the rate of
pollution continues to accelerate _exponentially_.

While it's marvelous that electric cars have become mainstream, they've had no
appreciable effect on actually _reducing_ pollution because–as it turns out–most
of the energy required to produce and operate these cars is still supplied by
fossil fuels (even though the cars themselves may be much more efficient).

It's true that _eventually_, we might reach a tipping point where there's enough
wind, solar, and nuclear generation capacity to start phasing out fossil fuels,
but [Jevons paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox) almost
guarantees this will never happen. As more alternative energy sources come
online, it will drive down the overall cost of energy, and demand will increase
in response to cheaper energy.

## Feedback loops

We also have a variety of feedback loops to worry about. There are the big
[climate feedback loops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_feedback),
which are not yet well understood, but it's unlikely they will work in our
favour, as the data currently suggests[^3].

![Climate change feedback loops](feedback.png "Climate change feedback loops")

One feedback loop not often discussed is the _human-induced_ carbon climate
feedback loop. The human loop is simple: as climate change accelerates, we'll
need even more energy to survive in an increasingly hostile climate. Because we
refuse to put a price on carbon, fossil fuels will ultimately be used as the
first choice to meet this increasing demand.

![Human feedback](human-feedback.png "Human-induced climate feedback loop")

The only way to escape this feedback loop is to put a price on carbon (i.e., a carbon tax). The only _real_ problem with a carbon tax is that no government wants to do it because of the fear that it may slow economic growth (which is a legitimate concern, it most likely _will_ slow economic growth). The alternative, of course, is cataclysm.

## 1.5°C is a pipe dream

Staying below 1.5°C is a pipe dream, and we've essentially already passed
2°C[^4]. There's no putting the proverbial cat back in the bag at this point, as
we have no way to undo the pollution on the time scale necessary to arrest
climate change.

![2°C achieved](era5_daily_sfc_temp_global_anomalies_ref1850-1900_1940-2023_dark.png "We've already hit 2°C")

2°C represents catastrophe, and going well beyond 2°C (which is very likely on our
current trajectory) amounts to a series of extreme global catastrophes, a
subject best left to science fiction authors to explore. One book I greatly
enjoyed was [The Ministry for the
Future](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ministry_for_the_Future).

In 2023 and 2023, global temperatures started rising rapidly, and
we began seeing 6 sigma deviations from historical means[^5]. Surface sea[^6]
and air[^7] temperatures have deviated significantly, especially in the North
Atlantic in 2023 and 2024. In the mainstream media this has been attributed to
[El
Niño](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni%C3%B1o%E2%80%93Southern_Oscillation),
though this framing tends to ignore the overall effect of climate change and
feedback loops.

## So what now?

I have nothing to offer in terms of solutions, other than to say that you should
do what you can to enjoy life while you're still able. I don't believe there's
adequate political will to solve the crisis, and I don't believe that we have
the technology or capability to do so while simultaneously increasing the GDP
every year, year after year, without engaging in war (i.e., the situation is
zero-sum, and for the West to survive the Global South will be sacrificed).

At the very least, if you're able to vote, you can try voting for candidates
that offer real solutions to the climate crisis: a carbon tax levied at the
point where the carbon is removed from the ground (i.e., the fossil fuel
companies need to pay).

[^1]: There's much debate about how _green_ green energy is. As it currently stands, a great deal of pollution is generated by the extraction of raw materials, production, transportation, and installation of wind, solar, and nuclear power sources. Theoretically, solar and wind could eventually meet the base load requirements, but there's no evidence in the data we have that this is happening at any significant scale.
