When most people talk about success, they're usually referring to the
accumulation of money, power, or material possessions. A bigger house, a fancier
car, an advanced degree from a prestigious university, a high-paying job with an
impressive title. Maybe you're so successful that you've retired from your day
job and now you spend your time doing high-profile non-profit work, partly to
impress your friends.

These common markers of success never quite resonated with me. When I think
about truly successful people, my mind goes to my mother. She never had a college
degree, but she raised a family, built a loving home, and somehow managed to keep
a smile on her face even through a long, difficult battle with cancer.

My mom was, by my measure, a profoundly successful woman. While certainly not
perfect, she was fundamentally a giver. Towards the people she cared about, she
was incredibly generous and thoughtful. She embodied qualities I admire and aspire
to. These are things I wish I'd told her more often while she was alive.

## The Limits of Conventional Success

Picture yourself on your deathbed. Will you be tallying your net worth, counting
your conquests, or scrolling through your social media followers? Probably not.
More likely, you'll wish you'd spent more quality time with loved ones and less
time chasing the next promotion. The square footage of your house or the
zero-to-sixty time of your car will seem utterly irrelevant.

A striking historical example is the Russian author Leo Tolstoy. Despite his
immense literary success and wealth, Tolstoy experienced a profound existential
crisis later in life. In his memoir *A Confession*, he describes how, after
achieving fame and fortune, he found himself questioning the meaning of life and
the value of his accomplishments. Ultimately, Tolstoy found greater fulfillment
not in accolades or possessions, but in simple living, spiritual growth, and his
relationships with others. His journey is a powerful reminder that external
success often fails to satisfy our deeper needs for meaning and connection.

What most people truly want, I believe, is to be surrounded by people they love
and who love them back, and to know they made a positive difference in those
people's lives. In this, my mom was a champion. She was enveloped in love until the
very end. This echoes findings from decades of research, like the Harvard Study of
Adult Development, which consistently shows that strong, positive relationships
are the single biggest predictor of long-term happiness, health, and even
longevity[^1]. One participant in the study, who had achieved great professional
success, reflected late in life that his most cherished memories were not of
career milestones, but of time spent with family and friends. Psychiatrist
George Vaillant, who directed the study for decades, famously summarized its
findings: "Happiness is love. Full stop." This real-life example from a landmark
study underscores the enduring importance of relationships over material
achievements.

It turns out there's a scientific reason why chasing bigger houses and faster
cars often feels unsatisfying. Psychologists call it the "hedonic treadmill"[^2][^2b].
We quickly adapt to positive changes in our lives–a raise, a new car, a bigger
house. The initial thrill fades, we return to our baseline happiness level, and we
start craving the *next* thing to get that temporary boost. We overestimate how
much happiness these external achievements will bring, trapping ourselves in a
cycle of desire and adaptation. The only way off this treadmill isn't to run
faster, but to fundamentally rethink what we're chasing.

## The Necessary Illusions?

Of course, let's be real. These traditional markers of success aren't entirely
divorced from reality. We *need* money to survive in the modern world. We need
shelter, food, clothing, and a way to get around. In that sense, striving for
financial stability and a comfortable life isn't inherently flawed.

Maybe the problem isn't the pursuit itself, but the *expectations* we attach to
it. Perhaps I shouldn't be so quick to dismiss someone else's pride in their big
house or fancy degree. If that's their definition of accomplishment, good for
them. They likely worked hard for it. Ultimately, success is a personal
definition. While research suggests the happiness boost from higher income tends
to diminish significantly after a certain point (though maybe not plateau
entirely)[^3], feeling secure and capable is undeniably important.

(And hey, if we *must* play the comparison game, consider this: a single New
York City subway car costs roughly $2 million. A full train has 8-10 cars. So, my
daily commute vehicle? Easily worth $16-20 million. Take that, luxury sedan!)

The crucial point isn't whether wanting these things is "bad," but understanding
*why* we want them. Are you buying that shiny new gadget because it genuinely
enhances your life, or because you hope it will make others *think* your life is
better? Are you pursuing that promotion for the challenge and growth, or for the
perceived status it confers?

## Choosing Your Own Compass

The antidote to chasing external validation is, perhaps paradoxically, a healthy
dose of selfishness—not the harmful kind, but the kind that prioritizes your
*own* internal compass. Stop worrying so much about what society, your parents, or
your Instagram feed tells you success looks like, and start tuning into what
truly matters *to you*.

I know I've wasted far too much energy trying to live up to others'
expectations. It's a futile exercise; our obsession with how others perceive us
looms far larger in our own minds than it does in anyone else's.

Figuring out what you genuinely care about is the real challenge. It's rarely
obvious, and it inevitably shifts over time. Your priorities at 15 were likely
different from your priorities now, and they'll change again in another 10, 20,
or 30 years. This capacity for growth and evolving interests is itself a source
of richness; studies link lifelong learning and curiosity directly to greater
well-being and life satisfaction[^4][^4b]. As I like to say, you should [always
be learning]({{<ref "always-be-learning">}}).

However, a good rule of thumb is to optimize for the present. Tomorrow isn't
guaranteed. Today is all you truly have.

Focusing on the present also shifts our attention outward, from what we can
accumulate to how we can connect and contribute.

## Give vs. Get: Shifting the Focus

Another lens through which to view success is the balance between giving and
getting. Society often emphasizes accumulation–what can I *get*? But my mom
exemplified the power of giving. She was thoughtful and generous, sometimes to a
fault.

This isn't just sentiment; research backs it up. Engaging in prosocial behaviors—
acts of kindness, volunteering, contributing to a cause—provides significant
psychological rewards. Giving enhances mood, fosters a sense of purpose,
strengthens social bonds, and contributes to lasting life satisfaction[^5][^5b].

Grand gestures can be nice, but don't underestimate the power of small, consistent
acts of kindness, especially those that cost nothing but time or attention. They
often feel more authentic than grand gestures, which can sometimes carry hidden
expectations or manipulative undertones.

## The Underrated Success of Presence

In our hyper-connected, overstimulated world, simply *being present* is an
increasingly rare and valuable skill. You might be tired of hearing me lament
our collective phone addiction, but I see it less as an addiction to the device
itself and more as a symptom of deeper unease. We often reach for our phones not
just to escape uncomfortable thoughts or feelings in the immediate moment, but
also as a subtle way to avoid confronting whether our current path aligns with
our internal values, defaulting instead to the easier distraction of external
metrics or validation. It's a subconscious flight from the present moment *and*
from authentic self-assessment.

Constantly planning the next vacation, obsessing over the next purchase, or
strategizing how to impress others pulls us away from experiencing our actual
lives. As I often say, you can't find lasting happiness if you're incapable of
finding contentment right here, right now, with who you are and where you are.
That exotic vacation provides a temporary rush, but the novelty fades. You bring
yourself, and your internal state, wherever you go. Homeostasis always reasserts
itself.

Perhaps I take it to an extreme, but these days, my greatest luxury is often
having nowhere specific to be and nothing urgent to do. Instead of a fancy
restaurant, I genuinely prefer quality time with my dogs and cooking at home.
Instead of jetting off somewhere, I prefer wandering through an unfamiliar part
of my city on foot, using one of my vintage Japanese cameras to capture
unexpected moments of beauty.

Try sitting on a park bench *without* your phone. Read a physical book.
People-watch. Instead of dreaming of a five-star hotel, what small changes could
make your own home feel more like a sanctuary?

Ask yourself: Are you taking that trip for the genuine experience, or for the
social media bragging rights? Are you visiting the museum out of real interest,
or to cultivate an image of sophistication? Are you reading that book because it
fascinates you, or because it's on some "must-read" list that you think will
impress others?

Being present means engaging authentically with yourself and your surroundings.
It means aligning your actions with your values, not performing for an imaginary
audience. True success isn't about convincing others you're successful; it's about
cultivating a life that feels genuinely good and meaningful *to you*. Research
consistently links mindfulness and presence with reduced stress, better emotional
regulation, and increased overall well-being[^6].

## Practical Steps Toward Authentic Success

How do you start shifting towards a more personally meaningful definition of
success? One simple, powerful tool is self-reflection. Regularly ask yourself:
"Why am I doing this? Is it truly for me, or is it primarily about how others
will perceive it?"

Are you going to that party because you genuinely want to connect with people,
or out of obligation? Do you need that expensive upgrade, or are you trying to
keep up with the Joneses (who are probably just as insecure as you are)?

Noticing the patterns in your motivations is the first step. This creates a
positive feedback loop: the more you align your actions with your authentic
desires, the better you'll feel, reinforcing the desire to be true to yourself.

[Writing things down]({{<ref "writing-things-down">}}) remains one of the best
ways to untangle your thoughts. You don't need a public blog; a private journal
works wonders. Try writing about your motivations, your evolving goals, and what
*your* unique definition of success looks like right now. The very act of
articulating these ideas clarifies them.

There's extensive research confirming the positive impact of journaling on
mental health and well-being. Studies, including systematic reviews and
controlled trials, consistently show that various forms of journaling—like
expressive writing (exploring thoughts and feelings about stressful events) or
gratitude journaling—can significantly reduce symptoms of anxiety, depression,
and general psychological distress[^7][^7b]. The simple act of translating
emotional turmoil into words seems to facilitate processing and offers a path
towards greater emotional clarity.

Beyond mood improvement, journaling is linked to enhanced emotional regulation,
increased resilience, and greater self-awareness[^8]. By regularly engaging with
your internal landscape on paper, you create an opportunity to identify
patterns, challenge unhelpful thoughts, and consciously cultivate a more mindful
and present state. Some studies even suggest tangible physical benefits,
possibly linked to stress reduction, like improved immune function or faster
recovery times[^9]. It's a powerful, low-cost tool for understanding yourself
and navigating life's complexities.

## Redefining the Finish Line

My personal definition of success clearly differs from the mainstream. I
recognize that for many, buying a first home or achieving a certain career
milestone represents a significant and valid form of success. That's perfectly
okay. Many probably view my perspective—seeing jobs and houses primarily as
means rather than ends—as eccentric, bordering on insane.

But regardless of where you currently stand, I invite you to take some time to
genuinely reflect: What does success *truly* mean to you, beneath the societal
noise? The more you clarify your own definition, the less power external
opinions will hold, and the freer you'll be to build a life that feels authentically
rich and fulfilling.

Start living by your own definition of success, and stop worrying what others
think.
