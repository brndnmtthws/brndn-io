Tools are often cited as an example of what separates humans from most other animals. And while it's true that other animals also use tools, humans are a bit unique in that we've also developed tools that make tools. My dogs (I have two, Doge and Walter) occasionally utilize tools, but due to their lack of opposable thumbs their tool usage is quite limited. My dogs' use of tools tends to be limited to acts which involve food or play.

There are much better examples than dogs of animals who employ tools, such as birds using sticks to get at hard-to-catch insects, or how octopuses use coconut shells to build shelters. For humans, however, I'd argue that our creation of tooling is arguably the most clever thing we do. In many ways, the only output of technology are tools: it's sometimes hard to understand what the purpose of the tool is, and how it works exactly, but nearly everything we build these days is a tool of some form.

## Tools as Force Multipliers

What makes tools so powerful is their ability to provide leverage—they allow us to accomplish more with less effort, time, and resources. Archimedes famously said, "Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world." This insight captures the essence of what makes tools valuable: they extend our natural capabilities beyond what our bodies alone could achieve.

In terms of our day to day lives, tools provide us with _leverage_, they allow us to accomplish more with less, we can automate repetitive tasks, and we can of course achieve tooling nirvana by creating tools that make the tools for us.

## The Evolution of Tools in the Digital Age

The most impactful technology companies of the current era got to where they are by creating tools that provided unprecedented leverage:

* **Communication tools**: The early internet pioneers created _email_, a way to send electronic mail to anyone anywhere on the globe, which later evolved into _instant messaging_, arguably one of the most valuable inventions that came out of the internet. What once required physical delivery systems, days of transit, and significant cost became instant and nearly free.

* **Information navigation tools**: Browsers were developed as a way to visualize and navigate content on the internet through a web of links between documents. The web browser is a tool that unlocked an incredible amount of new technologies by creating a standardized way to access and interact with distributed information.

* **Search tools**: Google made a search index that used a reputation-based algorithm called "PageRank" (a pun on how one cofounder was named _Page_) to build a search engine that was remarkably useful at the time. This tool condensed the entire web into an accessible, searchable format, providing unprecedented access to information.

* **Social tools**: Facebook created a simple tool for connecting with friends and family, exchanging messages, sharing photos, arguing about moral panics, political opinions, and spamming your conspiracy theories. While I'm being somewhat facetious, these platforms are remarkably powerful tools for human connection and information sharing.

* **Twitter**: Created a simple way to broadcast short messages to "followers"—people who willingly subscribe to your content. Despite my personal puzzlement at the format, it's undeniably a powerful tool for the rapid spread of ideas.

## Tools as Media and Message

Some tools are certainly more useful than others. For example, media is a tool for shaping the global consciousness, sometimes wielded by those with far more power than they deserve, like the modern day media barons and oligarchs. You may have heard the phrase ["the medium is the message"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_medium_is_the_message), which the [BBC also did a nice explainer on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ko6J9v1C9zE), and once understood properly is very difficult to un-understand. The media is not so much about delivering messages, but rather it's a modern day tool for controlling which messages are permitted to exist in the minds of those who tune in to the media delivery systems.

Marshall McLuhan (of "the medium is the message" fame) [also had much to say about ads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqaRAmO3SCg), recognizing that advertising itself is a tool—one designed to shape perception and desire.

## Tools for Creation: Leonardo's Example

One well known historical figure was a person named Leonardo from a town called Vinci in the Tuscany region of Italy. During his lifetime he was most well known for his artwork which included paintings and sculptures. Later he became more well known for his writings, contraptions, ideas, and various other creations which we mostly know about through his writings.

What's interesting about Leonardo's story is that he invented _tools_ to help create the timeless art we know him for today. The tools he invented allowed him to hide brushstrokes in the _Mona Lisa_, or present a mythological scene with a non-distorted perspective in _The Last Supper_. Prior to Leonardo's use of these techniques, art looked quite wonky to say the least.

Leonardo published his [_Treatise on Painting_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Treatise_on_Painting) with the general theme that painting (perhaps art, more generally) was in fact a science, not an art. One keen observation Leonardo made is presented as the _branching rule_, which is:

> All the branches of a tree at every stage of its height when put together are equal in thickness to the trunk

What's most interesting about Leonardo's observation is that it is, itself, a _tool_. You can apply this rule as a tool in your own artwork to make your trees look more realistic (if that's the goal).

## Modern Tools That Create Disproportionate Value

Today, we see numerous examples of tools that create enormous value by providing leverage in different domains:

1. **Development tools**: Frameworks like React or Next.js allow developers to build complex web applications with a fraction of the code and time previously required. Version control systems like Git enable collaboration that would be impossible otherwise.

2. **No-code tools**: Platforms like Webflow, Airtable, and Zapier allow non-technical people to create software solutions that would have required expensive development teams just a few years ago.

3. **Creative tools**: Digital audio workstations, video editing software, and design applications have democratized creation, allowing individuals to produce professional-quality work from their homes.

4. **AI tools**: Systems like GPT for text generation, DALL-E for image creation, or GitHub Copilot for code assistance extend human creativity by handling routine tasks and suggesting possibilities we might not have considered.

5. **Productivity tools**: Task management systems, note-taking applications, and communication platforms help us externalize our thinking and coordinate with others at unprecedented scales.

## The Magic of Abstraction

At some point the tools become so complex that we forget to think about tools as compositions of other tools either through supply chains or abstractions built atop abstractions, and instead we think of these tools as magic. Software seems to have this modern day appeal as being magical, so much so that we have started referring to any kind of software that appears complex beyond explanation as "AI". This is especially valuable to sales and marketing people who are trying to ride the AI hype wave which seems to have had a new renassaince recently thanks to some recent advances in text generation.

The most powerful tools often hide their complexity through abstraction. The smartphone in your pocket contains technologies that would have been considered miraculous just a few decades ago, yet we use them without understanding the intricate systems making them work. This abstraction itself is a meta-tool—it allows us to wield powerful capabilities without requiring us to understand their inner workings.

## Value Creation Through Tools

To sum up my core thesis in this rambling essay, I think the greatest value from technology is the creation of tools. The act of creation of any kind (whether it's art, tooling, food, or anything else that is new or novel) is the highest form of value creation. Merely hoarding wealth doesn't _create_ value, because money is imaginary and on its own it cannot _create_ anything, unless you use that money to pay someone who _is_ creative and has the skills to create new things like tools and art and cooking techniques that produce delicious foods.

The most profound tools share several characteristics:

1. They provide significant leverage, allowing users to accomplish much more with less effort
2. They lower barriers to creation, enabling more people to participate
3. They solve real problems that people encounter in their work or lives
4. They often become platforms upon which other tools can be built
5. They frequently disappear into the background, becoming infrastructure we take for granted

In other words: to create real value, focus on building tools that solve real problems or unlock new technologies. And perhaps the highest form of value creation is building tools that help others create tools—creating the leverage that creates leverage.

Our uniquely human capacity for recursive tool-making—creating tools that create tools that create tools—may be the most powerful force for progress we possess. It's a capability worth celebrating, understanding, and most importantly, putting to use in service of meaningful challenges.
