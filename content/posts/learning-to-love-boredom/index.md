I'm learning to get better at being bored. In the past, I wouldn't say I liked
boredom. And I _still_ tend to fill my free time more than I should with
"activities" when bored. Most of the time, the activities I choose to fill my
free time include: reading, writing, taking walks, watching TV or movies (as
much as I hate to admit), and occasionally a video game (which is _not_ a
passive activity, unlike TV).

But now, I'm learning to get better at being bored. Being bored is somewhat the
opposite of being busy: busyness is filling your time with something-or-other,
as if the sky will fall if you decide to take time for yourself and forget
about everything other than what's here now in the moment. I would say the
opposite of being busy is being idle, but boredom is another step past being
idle (perhaps, I suppose, this post is about being bored _and_ idle).

I usually get annoyed by people who claim to be "busy", mainly because busyness
is often used as an excuse not to do something when in reality, that person is
likely only busy in that they're busy avoiding the activity they don't want to do. Busyness is deployed as an easy generic excuse to avoid something, anything, or everything.

My brain runs at full speed at all times, _especially_ when I'm bored. This is
handy because I've noticed I tend to have my best ideas when bored, so I need
to maximize my time spent bored. I do my best thinking when I'm
doing some sort of boring activity, such as:

- taking a walk
- sitting on the toilet
- taking a bath or shower ([there's a whole subreddit for this](https://old.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/))
- waiting for the subway
- riding the subway

Calling these activities "boring" is unfair because these are rich and vibrant
activities with very low costs. You can do them with friends, too. Riding
the subway isn't free, but it's much less expensive and far more entertaining
than your typical Broadway show. I've always loved riding the subway, there's
something about the mix of people ("the great equalizer") you find on the
subway, and there's always poetry to read.

I've learned _not_ to automatically reach for anti-boredom consumption:
podcasts, audiobooks, Reddit (thankfully, the Apollo app is gone, so I no
longer use Reddit on my mobile phone), random news websites, etc. These days I
try _not_ to constantly reach into my pocket, pull my phone out, and get stuck
in the dopamine loop of continuously refreshing all the things for no reason
other than just executing the program in the grooves of my brain from having
being programmed into performing these actions to earn a blue or red or green
dot on my phone which feeds that dopamine addiction feedback loop endlessly.

If you're out for a walk in New York City and keep your phone in your pocket, you experience much more of the world. You can look around, see things
you might not otherwise notice, engage with people, have conversations with
strangers, _think_ about all sorts of things, and discover great ideas. It's
calming and soothing, like the best anti-anxiety medication but without the
side effects.

My two dogs (one of which _hates_ going on walks, if you can believe it) also
make it incredibly difficult to play with my phone while taking them on a walk,
so I rarely bring my phone when I go outside. They constantly require my full
attention, so I can't play on my phone even if I want to. I generally only take
my phone along if I'm going to be gone for a long while or _actually__ need it
for some reason (like to pay for things). Still, I prefer to leave it behind
because it forces me to engage with reality instead of escaping to the
metaverse. It helps me break free from the attention economy, and I don't
fear missing out.

Sometimes I think I _should__ bring my phone to make notes when a good idea
pops into my head because I often get great ideas and think I should write them
down immediately (perhaps for my next blog post and what-have-you). Alas, that
feeling fades as I remind myself that if the idea is good, it'll return to me
again, and when I feel inspired in the company of my MacBook, I can write it
down using a proper keyboard.

Ah, boredom. Like a breath of fresh air. Breaking that dopamine loop is hard,
but it's easier to break out once you recognize the patterns.

We should strive to be bored more often. Put the phone away, and try looking at
the clouds or the buildingsÂ and trees around wherever you happen to be enjoying
a pleasant stroll on a cool summer evening, or maybe engage with your friends
or family in a non-digital way and try to remember what it's like to be a human
who's not addicted to the machine if you happened to grow up in a time when
that was a thing.
