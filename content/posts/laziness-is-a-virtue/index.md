Young people are often fed some variation of the belief that hard work will be
rewarded; therefore, it's good and virtuous to work hard. While I do agree with
this sentiment, I think the same is also true of laziness. Unlike hard work,
laziness is generally regarded as a negative attribute, but this is just a
misunderstanding about what laziness truly is.

If we think for a moment about what it means to be lazy, we might visualize
someone lying on the couch watching TV, playing video games, or maybe
[hurkle-durkling](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=hurkle-durkle)
long after it's time to get up and out of bed. Another way we often think about
laziness is that it's the opposite of being productive, where to be "productive"
implies doing some work, chores, exercise, or self-improvement.

Laziness is–in my humble opinion–widely misunderstood and underappreciated.
It's not simply about doing nothing; rather, it's about avoiding excess
energy expenditure. That includes both physical and mental energy.

Anyone who's worked in any sort of creative profession (or simply been to
school) is fully aware of how much energy it takes to do creative work.
Creative work can be energizing, but it also requires a great deal of mental
resources, and you need ample downtime to recover. Consider a programmer who
spends hours solving a complex bug by thinking deeply about the problem instead
of brute forcing every possible solution, or a writer who waits for inspiration
rather than forcing words onto a page. I find physical work easier than mental
work because it's easier to understand your limits and get the right amount of
rest (for me, at least). The brain accounts for about 20% of your caloric needs,
which is quite remarkable considering the brain is only about 2% of your body
mass[^1] [^2].

There's also an essential biological imperative for why laziness is virtuous: we
evolved to conserve energy because, historically, food was scarce. If you can
accomplish the same amount of work (or merely an adequate amount) while
expending less energy, that's a win. Look at nature—lions sleep up to 20 hours a day
and only hunt when necessary. They're not considered lazy; they're considered efficient.
Work isn't a contest to see who can look the busiest or burn the most calories–although,
in some organizations, that's exactly what management believes.

I think of laziness as an important skill: if you can accomplish a task quickly
with minimal effort, you are succeeding. The legendary programmer Larry Wall listed
laziness as one of the three great virtues of a programmer, defining it as "the quality
that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall energy expenditure." The only
downside to being this skilled is that the reward for good work done quickly is more work,
so to work smart (as opposed to working hard), you should develop your laziness skills discreetly.

The polar opposite of laziness is busywork, which is more harmful than laziness
because you're wasting calories and brain energy for no good reason. Think of the person
who spends hours manually copying data that could be automated, or the meeting that could
have been an email, or the report that no one will ever read.

And to be clear, hard work is great too, but working hard just for the sake of
working hard is theatric wheel spinning in most cases. This is perhaps one
reason why exceptionally talented people are often remarked as "making it look
easy" when demonstrating their talents. The most efficient chef isn't the one frantically
rushing around the kitchen, but the one who plans their movements, conserves energy,
and produces excellent food with seemingly minimal effort.

So perhaps the next time you find a shortcut or an efficient way to complete a task,
don't think of it as being lazy—think of it as honoring an evolutionary imperative
to conserve your precious energy for the things that truly matter.
