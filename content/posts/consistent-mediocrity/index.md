Every January gym attendance spikes by nearly 150%, yet by mid-February about
90% of those new faces have vanished.[^1] We crave transformation, but sticking
around for the unglamorous middle is where real change happens.

Showing up regularly with "good enough" effort often outperforms sporadic bursts of
perfectionism. I admire people who are consistent, dependable, and reliable. And I
think you'll find, if you can simply show up consistently, you're more likely to
[achieve mastery]({{< ref "the-arduous-path-to-mastery" >}}) slowly than someone
who tries something a few times, gets frustrated, and gives up.[^2] But mastery isn't
always the goal, and that's perfectly fine. Sometimes, being _just okay_ at something
and enjoying the process is rewarding in itself.

Mediocrity, in this sense of steady effort, is often underrated. While the word
itself might carry negative connotations of simply "falling short," I want to
contemplate with you, the reader, its hidden strength when it represents
consistent, reliable effort. As someone who leans towards perfectionism, I know
this isn't always a good thing ("perfect is the enemy of good"). Sometimes we
need to learn to accept 'good enough,' because absolute perfection is–at best–an
illusion.

## The Problem with Perfectionism

Modern culture often pushes us towards an ideal of perfection that doesn't match
reality. Think about the picture-perfect vacations advertised: effortless bliss,
constant sunshine, zero problems. Real life, even in paradise, has its rainy
days and imperfections. This caricature of life, where everything is flawless,
sets an unattainable standard.

Furthermore, the constant stream of curated perfection on social media platforms
like Instagram and TikTok exacerbates this issue. We scroll through feeds filled
with idealized moments and carefully constructed images, a digital reality often
more appealing—and seemingly more perfect—than the sometimes messy, imperfect
reality right in front of us. This relentless exposure can make it harder to
appreciate, or even engage with, the 'good enough' moments of our own lives,
presenting a sharp contrast to the gradual, imperfect progress that true
consistency fosters.[^3]

## The Power of Showing Up

My favorite people are the ones who simply show up. It sounds easy, but consistent
presence is harder than it looks. It's a value I didn't fully grasp until later in life.
My parents tried to instill it, perhaps not always effectively, but experiencing
the impact of reliability (and unreliability) firsthand as an adult truly drove the
lesson home.

Showing up is the simplest way to be present and express genuine interest. A
friend who's consistently there is a real friend; one who's rarely around might
as well be an acquaintance. Despite its clear value, why do we often overlook
simple, dependable consistency? Perhaps it lacks the glamour or romance of
dramatic, heroic efforts, yet it's often far more impactful in the long run.

Often, showing up demands little effort—replying to a message, returning a call,
reaching out first. It's surprisingly common for these simple gestures to be
overlooked, perhaps because they lack the drama of grand efforts. Yet, this basic
consistency is a powerful signal of respect for another person's time and attention.

What is the cognitive bias in our thinking that leads us to devalue showing up?
This might be a case of the _novelty bias_: our brains over-value fresh,
dramatic outcomes and under-value quiet, repeated efforts. That's why we get so
excited about vacationing for a week: it gives us that hit of something new,
something fresh. Recognizing this quirk helps us appreciate the power of showing
up.

## Appreciating Routines

This leads to an appreciation for routines. While "routine" might sound boring
to some, I find routines comforting and rewarding. They provide predictability
and create the space needed for deep work, deep thought, deep connections, and
deep love.[^4] These all require consistent, uninterrupted showing up.

Building routines is how we build habits. [Being in control of your habits]({{< ref
"good-habits-bad-habits" >}}) is a powerful tool for achieving your goals, even if
that goal is simply to show up reliably.[^5]

## "Rome wasn't built in a day."

This isn't just a cliché; it reflects the reality that the vast Roman Empire,
with its intricate network of roads, aqueducts, and monumental structures, grew
not from a single grand plan perfectly executed, but through centuries of
incremental, consistent effort. Each road paved, each aqueduct segment
constructed, each law codified—these were the routine, often mundane, actions
that collectively built an enduring civilization. It underscores how significant
achievements often arise from the cumulative effect of persistent, small,
routine actions.

Much of success in life involves attrition: those who manage to stick around
long enough often become the experts, leaders, or respected figures in their
fields.[^6] Survival isn't always about being the absolute best; it's often about
persistence and not giving up. While it's true that you only live once, it's
also true that you only die once—so focus on sticking around rather than living
it up.

Routinely showing up, being present, and doing the work is almost always more valuable
than striving for unattainable perfection. Even in high-stakes fields like Formula 1,
consistency pays off; a driver can score significant points by finishing every race
safely, even without winning a single one.

Consider 1982: Keke Rosberg clinched the Formula 1 World Championship with just
_one_ race victory all season, beating faster rivals simply by finishing
consistently near the front.[^8]

## Practice Makes Progress (and Maybe Perfection)

Consistent mediocrity—showing up and putting in a decent effort regularly—often leads
to gradual improvement and, eventually, a surprising level of skill. When we focus on
building any skill or talent, consistent practice over time is the only reliable path
to expertise. There are no real shortcuts.

Take Thomas Edison's relentless pursuit of a practical incandescent light bulb.
His success wasn't a single flash of brilliance but the culmination of
methodical, persistent experimentation. Reports often mention _thousand_ of
unsuccessful attempts—with figures ranging from over 1,000 to as many as
10,000—before finding a viable filament material.[^7] Edison famously viewed
these attempts not as failures but as discoveries of what _didn't_ work,
stating, "I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that _won't_ work." He
didn't wait for the perfect design to materialize; he actively persisted through
iteration and imperfection, embodying the power of consistent effort over
paralyzing perfectionism.

You don't need to strive for perfection, but by simply showing up consistently over time,
you might accidentally discover one day that you've become quite good at whatever it is.
I've certainly found this to be true in my own life—I've inadvertently developed competence
in several areas simply because I enjoyed them and kept at them, day after day.

There's still plenty I'm not good at, which means endless opportunities for growth.
That potential excites me and keeps me showing up, practicing the things I want to
improve at.

Try it this week: pick one area—writing, exercise, calling a friend—and commit
to showing up.
