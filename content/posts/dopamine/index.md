Dopamine is a chemical in our brains associated with good feelings. Rather
than explaining it myself, I'll share a quote from the book _"The Righteous
Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion"_, (pp. 102-103):

> All animal brains are designed to create flashes of pleasure when the animal does something important for its survival, and small pulses of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the ventral striatum (and a few other places) are where these good feelings are manufactured. Heroin and cocaine are addictive because they artificially trigger this dopamine response. Rats who can press a button to deliver electrical stimulation to their reward centers will continue pressing until they collapse from starvation.

> [Drew] Westen found that partisans escaping from handcuffs (by thinking about the final slide, which restored their confidence in their candidate) got a little hit of that dopamine. And if this is true, then it would explain why extreme partisans are so stubborn, closed-minded, and committed to beliefs that often seem bizarre or paranoid. Like rats that cannot stop pressing a button, partisans may be simply unable to stop believing weird things. The partisan brain has been reinforced so many times for performing mental contortions that free it from unwanted beliefs. Extreme partisanship may be literally addictive.

In the text above, the author is discussing why politically divided
individuals get so heated about politics. One
suggestion, as the author notes, is that tribal signalling triggers a
dopamine reward in the brain.

## Tech companies and dopamine

Modern apps like Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, Twitter, Reddit, HN, and so on have been optimized to provide a strong hit of dopamine.

An example of this are notifications, often in the form of a little red dot. Every time you see one, you feel an urge to check your notifications and when you do you get dopamine reward. We're Pavlov's dog and notifications are our little treat.

You may be wondering: how did we arrive here? Was there some nefarious plot by thought leaders at tech cos to build products that are literally addictive? The true answer—in most cases at least—is that no, there was no effort to make things addictive, _per se_.

However, it _can_ be said that the addictiveness of these apps is a side effect of how they were optimized. It just so happens that the same actions that increase engagements metrics are well correlated with things which trigger a dopamine release in the brain.

## How did we get here?

Through the heavy use of A/B testing within many companies, we have slowly created products highly optimized for engagement.
