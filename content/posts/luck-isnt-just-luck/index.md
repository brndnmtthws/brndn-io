When it comes to people who are insanely successful, in the vast majority of
cases their success comes from a combination of 2 things: rich parents and luck.
When I say "rich parents", I generally mean _relatively_ rich parents. It
doesn't matter how genius you are if you grow up poor with no opportunities, you
won't get far in life because the world is not a meritocracy.

Luck, on the other hand, is a bit more complicated. It's not just about being at
the right place at the right time, but it requires being lucky enough to have
things go right many, many times in a row. Success compounds on itself, so being
lucky once or twice isn't enough.

There are also a bunch of other factors which are strictly luck:

* Being born in a rich country
* Being born in a rich family
* Being born with good genes
* Being born in a time of peace
* Being born in a time of technological advancement
* Being born with a good personality
* Being born able bodied
* Being born with enough intelligence to put your luck to good use
* Being born in the first place (which, by the way, is a 1 in 400 trillion
  chance)

There's essentially nothing anyone can do about any of these things, so it's
strictly a matter of luck. Most of these factors are environmental and beyond
our control as individuals.

This flies in the face of the "hard work" mantra, which is often used to justify
the success of the rich and famous. The truth is, most of them were just lucky.
Being lucky isn't a bad thing, but you should never confuse luck for genius or
hard work.

Hard work is great if you can combine it with your inherent privilege, but it's
not a substitute for it. If you're not lucky, you're going to have to work a lot
harder to get the same results as someone who is. And even then, you might not
get there.

The term ["tabula rasa"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabula_rasa) is latin for
_blank slate_, and it's the idea that we're all born with a blank slate mind,
and our success in life is determined by our actions. This is a nice idea, but
unfortunately the world doesn't work like that. A child born in poverty in a
war-torn country is not going to have the same opportunities as a child born in
a wealthy, peaceful country, even if they have an off-the-charts IQ, a great
work ethic, a winning personality, a beautiful face, a perfect body, and so on.
There may be exceptions, yes, but everything in the universe comes down to
probabilities and when all the cards are stacked against you, the odds are not
in your favor.

We are not, however, born with a blank slate mind. So much of who we are is a
matter of genetics, environment, and innate behaviour passed along from our
ancestors through our DNA. Twin studies, for example, have shown that identical
twins raised separately are more similar than fraternal twins raised together,
which suggests that genetics play a huge role in who we are.

In psychology, the debate over nature vs. nurture has been ongoing for ages, but
most of the evidence points to the fact that while the _nuture_ part is
important, in practice the _nature_ part is vastly more important. This goes
against the tabula rasa idea, and it's something that a lot of people want to
reject because it doesn't fit the world believe that anyone can be anything if
they just work really hard.

Ideas like tabula rasa might be comforting, but I think people can fall into the
trap of believing in what amounts to fairy tales simply because nobody wants to
tell them the truth. Classic examples of this are people who work in the arts
and have ambitions of being a famous musician, painter, actor, and so on, but
they simply lack the awareness to see that they're not talented enough to make
it. Some exceptions exist, but generally this sort of distribution is true for
many things that select for the best of the best (like sports, youtube
celebrities, onlyfans models, and so on). The distribution of gains is not
linear, it's exponentially biased towards the very tippy-top of the pyramid.

Plenty of people are happy to sell you the dream of being the next big thing.
For example, there are now youtube training camps for children who want to
become the next big youtuber. If you have to go to youtube training camp to
become a youtuber, you're probably not cut out for it.

We're not completely powerless, of course. We have enough free will that we're
not subject to the whims of fate, nor are we merely floating in the wind like a
leaf. We make our own choices, and we can choose to put ourselves into
situations that improve the odds of our luck. For example, if you want to be a
famous musician, you can move to a city with a thriving music scene, or if you
want to be a famous actor, you can move to Hollywood. If you work in computers,
you can move to Silicon Valley. You can also network with like-minded
individuals to improve your odds of making the right connections. You can
improve your skills with practice, and so on.

I suppose the final point I'm trying to make is that we should all be grateful
for what we do have, because simply being born in a Western country (for
example) is a huge privilege, and statistically incredibly unlikely. We can't
all be the next Taylor Swift, but we can all be grateful for the privilege of
being alive and having the opportunities we do have.

Being ambitious is great, but so is practicing gratitude and being realistic
about your own abilities (doing otherwise is setting yourself up for
disappointment).
