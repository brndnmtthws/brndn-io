We live in a society, or so they say. And as members of society–a community of
interdependent people–we should probably strive to contribute positively.
Society (and community) can provide tremendous value when it works.

It's easy to contribute negatively, or rather, to detract. Simple examples of
detracting from society might be:

- excessive consumption
- excessive pollution
- causing harm to others
- not contributing back

Society is more than the sum of its parts, but measuring its value is difficult. What
constitutes society is difficult to define, and the value of community is not
something we can easily assign a number to, particularly in an economic system
that doesn't account for happiness.

When a neighbour helps you out without expecting anything in return, we can't
necessarily measure the value of their help in terms of gross domestic product.
If your neighbour saved you from having to hire someone to solve a problem, then
the net effect on GDP would be neutral as no financial transaction occurred
(which means there's no value to measure). Even a child could tell you that
having a good neighbour is a positive thing in your life, however, our economic
models place no value on being a good neighbour.

Getting back to the topic of this post: it's not difficult to contribute
positively to society, and I generally try to live my life in such a way that
I'm (at the very least) not detracting. Christianity[^1] (and other religions)
provide some good ideas on how to contribute positively, as with avoiding the
seven deadly sins which are detractors:

1. Pride
2. Gluttony
3. Lust
4. Greed
5. Envy
6. Wrath
7. Laziness (sloth)

Most of these are bad, although one stands out from the rest: **lust** is hardly
sinful and mostly harmless (provided there's no abuse involved). Love and lust
are natural healthy parts of the human experience and one of the few things you
can do without having to spend money or get permission from any third parties or
government agencies (at least in places where you're free to love who you
please). Christianity has a long history of shaming people for celebrating their
bodies and loving who they want, so we can ignore this one sin and focus on the
others.

If I had to pick one sin as the most sinful of sins, I would choose **greed**. I
think the majority of modern societal problems today can be traced back to
greed. Everyone's trying to screw everyone else (and I don't mean in a good way)
to get rich quickly, and it generally makes everything worse for everyone (the
enshittification of everything).

We should also discuss the so-called "Golden Rule", which is best described as
not treating others in ways you don't wish to be treated. To put it in more
contemporary parlance: don't be an asshole. This is the easiest way to
contribute positively to society, but it's something many people struggle with
at various points in their lives.

The idea of contributing positively to society is hardly new, as noted, but it's
good to occasionally take a moment to think about whether you _are_ contributing
positively. And instead of applying a lot of pressure on yourself to make net
positive contributions, it may be easier to reduce the amount of net negative
contribution.

Life is a series of choices we make every day, with some decisions bigger than
others, and most of the time our options are imperfect. No matter how
insignificant the choice, we can at least choose to be a little less negative.
Help your neighbour if you can, don't litter, and find something to work on that
doesn't make the world a worse place.
