I've never been great at talking to people, especially strangers, but I'm much better than I used to be. In this post I'll share some of the things I've learned in my quest to be a better human.

![Friends](cover.jpg "It's good to have friends")

One of the easiest things you can do to improve your life is to get better at interacting with everyone you meet. The more good interactions you have in life, the more friends you'll make, and the more doors will open for you. Being likeable goes a really long way. Humans are very social creatures, and we're happiest when we have strong connections and communities.

The first thing I'll say is that practice is extremely important. If you want to improve your skills, just keep trying until you succeed more often.

## Find Ways to Engage

I've never been what you could call an outgoing or extroverted person, but I've always looked for opportunities to make sure I'm interacting with new people. It's good to make new connections, expand your network, and find friends. Most of the time the best way to do this is by meeting people face to face, in real life. These are a few examples of how I've done that.

In 2014 I decided to start driving for Lyft on evenings and weekends (while I was still working at Airbnb). I did this for 2 reasons:

1. When I exercised my Airbnb stock, I wound up with an enormous AMT bill and I wanted extra cash to pay it off
2. I figured that driving for Lyft would be a good way to practice talking to strangers which is something I knew I still sucked at

Driving for Lyft was great because I was forced to meet someone new and have a conversation every 20-30 minutes. I had a lot of memorable, boring, and sometimes downright peculiar interactions with a diverse set of random individuals (and groups, too).

Eventually I abandoned my Lyft gig, but it was _very_ good practice. It helped me realize that most people are friendly, although plenty of people are jerks, and that if you speak to people kindly they are likely to reciprocate. Getting outside your comfort zone is hard, but the more you do it the easier it gets.

In 2016 I did a cross country bike trip (from SF to NYC) where I got to chat with lots of different people from a variety of different backgrounds. The thing that was most surprising to me during that trip was how nearly universally everyone I met was kind, friendly, and willing to help. People often stopped to offer water, food, or whatever. In some cases people even opened their homes to me.

On the very first day of the trip I got heat stroke on a country road near Modesto (the air temperature was well over 40°C), collapsed on the side of the road, and if not for a retired police officer who happened to drive by, recognize that I was in trouble, and poured water on my body immediately, I may not be here today.

These days I try to get out to meetups or events that seem interesting, especially those related to technology or startups. I'm not a big fan of social outings that consist primarily of binge drinking, loud bars, or expensive dinners, but I'm willing to make exceptions for the right groups of people.

## The Digital Dimension

Since this article was first written, our social landscape has transformed dramatically. The pandemic forced many of us to interact primarily through screens for months or years. While in-person interaction is returning, digital communication remains a crucial skill.

Here are some tips for effective digital communication:

- **Turn your camera on** for video calls when possible. Facial expressions and visual cues are important for building rapport.
- **Combat Zoom fatigue** by scheduling shorter meetings and taking breaks between calls.
- **Be mindful of the "digital divide"** – some people appear more confident online than in person, and vice versa.
- **Join digital communities** like Discord servers, Twitter spaces, or Clubhouse rooms related to your interests.
- **Consider audio-first socializing** like podcast-style conversations or voice chats, which can feel more intimate than text but less draining than video.

Research from Stanford[^1] suggests that constant video calls are mentally exhausting partially because we're hyper-aware of being observed. Try suggesting a phone call or walking meeting as alternatives when appropriate.

## Listen First, Talk Second

One of the first things anyone needs to understand about talking to people is that you have to practice listening _first_. If you find yourself doing more than 50% of the talking most of the time, you're probably doing it wrong. If you're constantly talking, the other party never gets to actually participate in the conversation and won't be engaged. Avoid interrupting no matter how important you think your current thought is while someone else is talking.

A conversation should involve back and forth. It's not a speech, you're not there to talk at them, and you should make sure you hear their thoughts too.

This rule becomes even more important in virtual settings. The natural conversational rhythm is disrupted by slight delays and the absence of subtle body language cues. Some effective tactics include:

- Leave intentional pauses after someone finishes speaking to ensure they're done
- Use visual cues like slightly raising your hand if you want to speak next
- In group settings, consider using the chat function to indicate you have something to add without interrupting

## Get People Talking About Themselves

I remember when I was younger I always had a fear of asking people personal questions. I was worried they might get offended if I ask them a question they didn't like.

What I know now, that I didn't know then, is how much people _love_ talking about themselves. If you ask someone a question about themselves, they will most likely be happy to tell you everything they can about it until you interrupt them or change the subject. It also makes other people feel good because it demonstrates that you have an interest in who they are.

In other words: **ask a lot of questions**, and ask personal questions about _them_. However, make sure you know what's appropriate and not appropriate for the given situation and level of familiarity.

The "I" vs. "You" ratio in conversation is a useful metric to track. Try to use "you" more often than "I" when framing questions and responses. For example, instead of "I think that project sounds interesting," try "What excited you most about that project?"

## Escalation

You can't start a conversation in big talk mode, you have to begin with small talk. From small talk you can move on to medium talk, and eventually from medium talk you can get to big talk.

Sometimes you're allowed to break this rule, but it's a pretty well established social convention that you have to start from small talk first. People are not likely to let their guard down around strangers right from the start.

I've noticed there is one short circuit for getting people out of small talk mode quickly: **be funny**. And if you're not good at being funny, at the very least _be genuine and kind_.

An interesting development I've observed in post-pandemic interactions is that people sometimes skip the small talk phase more readily. After years of isolation, many are eager for deeper connection and meaningful conversation. A question like "What's something you discovered about yourself during the pandemic?" can fast-track a conversation to a more substantial level.

## Have Shared Interests

Conversations don't go far when you have nothing to talk about. You can only say so much about the weather or the local sports team before you run out of things to discuss. And definitely don't start talking about political or religious subjects unless it's actually appropriate to do so.

![Baby Doge, my sheeb](night-doge.jpg "Baby Doge, my sheeb")

One trick, which I have many times suggested to others, is to get a dog. I get approached _constantly_ by strangers every day because of the fact that I have a dog, and she's kind of cute. There's a lot of other great benefits that come along with having a dog such as [reduced risk of heart disease](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/having-a-dog-can-help-your-heart--literally) (likely because of having to walk your dog every day). A lot of people love dogs and it's an easy subject to talk to just about anyone about.

If you don't have a dog, then find groups of new people with shared interests to interact with. Try meetup.com, Reddit meetups, or whatever your preferred social platform is.

The range of digital interest groups has exploded in recent years. Beyond traditional meetups, there are now:

- **Virtual hobby clubs** for everything from cooking to coding
- **Online gaming communities** that form strong social bonds
- **Co-working Discord servers** where remote workers gather to simulate office camaraderie
- **Newsletter communities** where writers and readers connect
- **Cohort-based courses** that create tight-knit alumni networks

Finding your digital tribe can be as valuable as local connections. The best approach is combining both worlds—using digital platforms to discover people, then transitioning to in-person meetings when possible.

## Be Approachable

While the dog trick is a great way to make yourself more approachable, there are a few other things you can do as well. For starters, don't walk around with headphones all the time (AirPods, _sigh_). Adjust your body language so you don't look closed off to conversation. Don't dress like a slob, but also don't dress too fancy because it may intimidate some people.

Smiling is a fairly universal human signal of friendliness. If you can smile, do that.

In digital environments, approachability takes different forms:

- **Responsive communication**: Aim to respond to messages within a reasonable timeframe
- **Personalized profiles**: Use authentic photos and bios that share something interesting about you
- **Active listening symbols**: Use appropriate emoji reactions or short affirmations to show you're engaged
- **Visible availability status**: Let people know when you're free to chat

## Offer Something

To keep people engaged, it's good to give them a reason to talk to you. If you want to meet the person again, tell them that. If you can help them in some way, let them know.

The concept of "give before you get" has become a cornerstone of modern networking. Consider:

- Sharing useful articles or resources without expectation of return
- Making introductions that benefit others
- Offering your specific expertise for quick consultations
- Highlighting others' achievements on social platforms

A 2020 study by Harvard Business School found that people who engage in "generous" networking (focusing on giving rather than taking) build stronger and more valuable professional relationships over time[^2].

## Know When to Leave People Alone

Cold approaches are hard, and sometimes people just don't want to talk to you. It's probably not personal, it probably has nothing to do with your appearance, it may simply be that they're focused on other things and don't want to be bothered. If this happens, just let it go and move on.

This advice is doubly important in digital spaces, where boundaries can be less clear. Unsolicited messages, excessive tagging, or repeatedly trying to engage someone who isn't responsive crosses from networking into nuisance territory. Respect digital boundaries just as you would physical ones.

## Reading the Virtual Room

One of the hardest skills to develop in the digital age is understanding engagement levels without traditional cues. Here are some signals to watch for:

- **Response time**: Consistently delayed responses may indicate low interest
- **Response length**: Short, perfunctory replies often signal disengagement
- **Reciprocity**: Are they asking questions back or just answering yours?
- **Enthusiasm indicators**: Use of exclamation points, emojis, or GIFs can signal engagement
- **Follow-up initiatives**: Do they ever initiate conversations or only respond?

## Practice, Practice, Practice

I've already said it, but I'll repeat myself by closing on this note: like anything in life, you'll get better the more you practice. Get out, meet new people, and just _talk_ to them.

Whether in person or through a screen, human connection remains one of life's most rewarding pursuits. The tools and contexts may change, but the fundamental principles of good conversation—curiosity, respect, attentiveness, and generosity—remain timeless.
