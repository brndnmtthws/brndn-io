It's surprisingly easy to form habits. And it's less difficult to break them
than it may seem at first, with some exceptions (nicotine, for example, is
notoriously addictive and hard to quit).

I read _Tiny Habits_ by BJ Fogg, and I found it to be a lot of words to say
something that could be summarized in a few sentences. But the core idea is
solid: start small and slowly build up until a thing becomes habitual. Breaking
habits is the same but opposite: quitting cold turkey often fails, but slowly
reducing the habit can be effective.

When it comes to habits, I like to occasionally take a habit inventory.
Sometimes, I inadvertently develop habits that I later realize are not
beneficial and need to break them. Other times, I realize that I've stopped
doing something that I should be doing, and I need to start doing it again.

For example, not long ago, I got into the habit of snacking before bedtime. This
started because I was hungry one evening and decided to make a snack...and then
I did the same thing the next day, and so on. At some point I realized I needed
to kick this habit, and so I did. In this particular instance, I just stopped
doing it, and that was that.

Developing good habits is a powerful way to improve your life. A common example
of this is getting into the habit of regular exercise. It's hard to start, but
once you do, it becomes easy to maintain, provided you continue the habit. The
same is true for many other habits, such as reading, writing, or meditating.
With exercise in particular, I tend to reject the concept of rest days because
rest days just turn into extra rest days, and before I know it I haven't
exercised in a week. I find it easier to just exercise every day, even if it's
just a little bit, and simply adjust the intensity as needed.

You can combine habits with routines, which reinforces the habit. For example,
you can exercise at the same time every day, or you can read for a few minutes
before bed. This can help you remember to do the habit and make it easier to
maintain.

The more you can put your habits on autopilot, the easier they are to maintain.
Having positive and negative associations can either reinforce or break a habit.
For example, some people want to smoke when they drink and have built up an
association between the two. Breaking that association can help break the habit,
rather than just trying to quit smoking outright.

Certainly the best thing is to avoid bad habits in the first place, but we're
all human and have our vices. The key is to recognize when a habit is forming
and take steps to either reinforce it or break it, as needed.

I like to think about habits as a tool like any other, one that you can use for
positive or negative purposes. The more you understand how habits work, the
better you can use them to your advantage. Whether it's your fitness goals,
learning new skills, or just improving your life in general, habits are
something you should pay attention to.
