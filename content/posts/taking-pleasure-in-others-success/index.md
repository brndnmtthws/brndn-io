There's a TV show called _Love on the Spectrum_. It's one of my favourite TV
shows–for a number of reasons–but I think the reason I like it so much is that I
really want to see everyone on the show succeed. And it feels really good when
they do succeed, often bringing tears.

If you aren't familiar with it, the show is a documentary series about people on
the autistic spectrum (to varying degrees) who are trying to find romantic
partners. It's not a gameshow, there's no prize at the end, the producers of the
series simply document the lives of these people. I think there's definitely
some help from the producers (for finding dates, providing dating advice, and so
forth), but for the most part they don't interfere (or so it seems). Granted,
the people on the show have become celebrities to some degree, so I don't think
it's difficult for them to find dates, but that doesn't really change much about
the challenge of dating with autism.

## The Temptation of Tearing Others Down

It's a strange human tendency, but many of us, myself included sometimes, can
find a peculiar sort of satisfaction when others stumble or fail. This feeling,
often called Schadenfreude, seems particularly strong when directed towards
people we dislike or perhaps envy. While the feeling might provide a fleeting
sense of superiority, it often leaves a bitter aftertaste.

This tendency manifests clearly online. Entire communities sometimes spring up,
dedicated to dissecting the lives and perceived flaws of public figures or even
ordinary people. Gossip, criticism, and negativity can become consuming,
creating echo chambers where tearing others down feels like a bonding activity.
Similarly, some online dating-related groups can devolve into platforms for
public shaming rather than support. Research suggests that excessive exposure to
this kind of online negativity and gossip can significantly harm mental
well-being, increasing anxiety, depression, and eroding social trust.[^4]

Even mainstream media can fall into this pattern, focusing heavily on the
perceived wrongdoings of certain individuals. While holding people accountable
is important, the constant stream of negativity directed at public figures can
feel less like news and more like a collective obsession with disapproval. It
raises the question: does dwelling on others' flaws actually make us feel better
or improve anything?

## The Science Behind the Negativity

Why do we sometimes take pleasure in others' misfortune or get drawn into
negativity? The feeling of joy when seeing others fail, known as Schadenfreude,
isn't just a quirky personality trait; it activates reward centers in our
brains, particularly when the misfortune happens to someone we envy or perceive
as a rival.[^1] Interestingly, this response can be stronger in individuals with
lower self-esteem, perhaps as a way to temporarily feel better about oneself
through social comparison.[^2]

_(Guilty as charged.)_

Adding to this is our brain's inherent "negativity bias." Evolutionarily, paying
attention to threats and negative events was crucial for survival. As a result,
negative experiences often have a stronger psychological impact than positive or
neutral ones. This bias can make online negativity, gossip, and criticism feel
particularly potent and draw us in more easily than positive content.[^4] It's
worth remembering that often [it's never as bad as it seems]({{< ref
"its-never-as-bad-as-it-seems" >}}).

## Choosing Joy Instead

I'm tired of the negativity that often permeates online spaces. It's easy to get
drawn into the outrage cycle–it's often designed to be alluring (click that
bait, sell those ads). I've made a conscious effort to recognize when I'm
getting pulled into that vortex and step back. For me, this means limiting
exposure to constant news cycles–research consistently links high consumption of
negative news to increased anxiety, stress, and symptoms of depression[^8]–and
curating my online experience to focus on more constructive or informative
content. There's still value to be found, but it requires navigating carefully.

This brings me back to _Love on the Spectrum_. The show resonates deeply, partly
because the participants' struggles often feel incredibly relatable. Like many,
I find connecting with others challenging, and the vulnerability shown on screen
is striking. But the most powerful aspect is the genuine joy I feel witnessing
their successes.

The participants are [authentic]({{< ref
"when-youre-authentic-rejection-is-a-gift" >}}), courageous, and put themselves
out there not for fame, but with a sincere desire to find connection and love.
Seeing them navigate challenges and achieve moments of happiness is genuinely
uplifting. It's a powerful reminder that celebrating others' victories can bring
immense satisfaction. This feeling of finding joy in others' success, sometimes
called "compersion," is essentially the opposite of Schadenfreude. Actively
cultivating it can strengthen social bonds and even improve our own sense of
well-being.[^3]

## What is Love, Anyway?

My own path hasn't led to the kind of romantic love seen on the show, and
perhaps it never will. But romance is just one facet of love's spectrum, and
perhaps [redefining success]({{< ref "defining-success" >}}) is part of the journey.

![Love is love](1.jpg "Love is love")

Love means different things to different people. There's often a focus on
_receiving_ love, as if it's something we're owed or that should simply happen
_to_ us. Many wait to be swept off their feet, wanting to be passengers rather
than active participants in creating loving connections. You complain about your
"bad dates", while failing to acknowledge that _you_ are 50% of the date. While
that might work for some, building love often requires effort, intention, work,
compromise. Psychological perspectives actually emphasize love as an active
process of _giving_–through kindness, effort, and thoughtful actions–which is
strongly linked to the giver's own happiness and fulfillment.[^6]

Consider the love shared with pets. My dogs, for example, offer incredible
affection, but our bond isn't entirely unconditional. It's built on mutual care:
I provide food, walks, and attention, and they return it with a loyalty and
warmth that's hard to describe.

![Looove](2.jpg "Looove")

Perhaps true commitment involves embracing the less glamorous parts of caring
for another being–like cleaning up after them daily without complaint. It
requires setting aside pride and selfishness. This act of consistent, selfless
care is a profound form of giving love. Caring for animals often requires this
kind of selfless attention, and the human-animal bond built through such
empathetic interactions can foster greater compassion and prosocial behavior
more broadly.[^7]

![Real love](3.jpg "Real love")

Ultimately, real love might be about seeing someone clearly, accepting them
fully–flaws and all–in the present moment. It's the opposite of pretending
to care while secretly wishing they were different. And sometimes, love means
making difficult choices, like letting someone go when you know deep down that
the connection isn't right.

## Give Love, Especially When It's Hard

Watching _Love on the Spectrum_ is satisfying because seeing people overcome
odds to find happiness offers hope. Even if I face my own struggles in finding a
partner (or simply getting a date), knowing that success _is_ possible for
others feels good. Celebrating their wins becomes a source of joy in itself.
This act of celebrating others fosters connection and counteracts the negativity
bias that can sometimes dominate our attention.[^3]

Giving is often harder than receiving; creating is harder than consuming. Giving
love is an act of creation, while passively waiting to receive it is
consumption. This doesn't diminish the importance of being loved, but highlights
the active, often challenging, nature of truly _giving_ love.[^6] Research suggests
that engaging in acts of kindness and focusing on others' well-being (forms of
giving love) can significantly boost our own happiness and life satisfaction.

People express and perceive love differently. While concepts like the "5 Love
Languages" might oversimplify things, they serve as a useful metaphor:
understanding and connection require learning to speak and recognize each
other's unique ways of showing care ([learning to listen first]({{< ref
"speak-last" >}}) is key). It's a nuanced dance, not a simple
checklist.

The beautiful thing about giving love is its accessibility. It's available to
offer anywhere, anytime. It doesn't necessitate grand gestures or constant
declarations. Often, the simplest starting point is choosing _not_ to hate.

Hate is love's corrosive opposite. We often dispense negativity freely while
struggling to express warmth or appreciation. Choosing love, empathy, and
celebration over cynicism and criticism is the harder, but ultimately more
rewarding, path. Instead of getting consumed by distant figures or online dramas
we can't control, perhaps the best use of our energy is to cultivate love and
positivity in our immediate surroundings–within our communities, families, and
friendships, [contributing positively]({{< ref "contributing-positively" >}})
where we can. Focusing locally fosters a sense of empowerment and connection,
directly benefiting our well-being in ways that dwelling on large-scale
negativity often doesn't.[^5]

It's easier said than done, of course. It's a practice, and like any practice,
it requires ongoing effort. I know I'm still working on it.
