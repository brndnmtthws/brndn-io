At the yoga studio, many people come and go. Often, you encounter newcomers who treat their first yoga class like a [HIIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-intensity_interval_training) workout. They rush through transitions, sometimes literally jumping between poses (āsanas). In their minds, yoga seems less like a deliberate flow and more like a race to the finish line. They might substitute five rapid pushups for a single, controlled chaturanga (often missing the pose's subtleties), and fly through their upward-facing dog without syncing movement to breath.

If some of those terms are unfamiliar, don't worry. They're common in yoga, but their specific meanings aren't essential for this post's core message. The key takeaway involves the *pace* of movement.

For a little context: āsanas are the poses held in yoga. In vinyāsa classes, a popular style, you flow between these poses in a dance-like sequence, synchronizing movement with breath. "Taking a vinyāsa" often refers to a specific sequence: moving from plank (like a push-up start) down to chaturanga (a halfway-down push-up with elbows tucked), transitioning into upward-facing dog (rolling over the toes, lifting the chest, straightening arms), and finally settling into downward-facing dog (hips high, heels grounding).

The transitions between these distinct āsanas constitute the "flow," and linking this flow to the breath is fundamental to vinyāsa yoga. The tendency for newcomers, however, is often to rush.

## It's Not a Race

Some people approach yoga with the same intensity they bring to other workouts: go fast, go hard. There's nothing inherently wrong with that intensity if it serves their goals.

However, as one deepens their practice, a realization often dawns: it's actually *harder* to move slowly. Learning to flow deliberately through transitions, treating yoga more like a mindful dance between breath and body and mind than a speed competition, often distinguishes experienced practitioners.

The "flow" in yoga can mean connecting poses smoothly, but it also points toward achieving the *[flow state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology))*—a state of complete absorption in the activity. This mental flow is part of what makes yoga a mindful practice; it helps worries melt away as focus shifts entirely to the physical sensations and the rhythm of movement, quieting the restless monkey mind.

## Why Slow is Hard

The idea that moving slowly, [thinking slowly]({{< ref "thinking-slowly" >}}), or progressing slowly is *hard* might seem counterintuitive. Our culture often values speed and quick results over deliberate, careful action. Slow movement encourages thoughtfulness, precision, and intention. Fast movement is often reactive, impulsive, shooting from the hip.

In a yoga class, moving slowly means muscles work for longer, often [isometrically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometric_exercise). This increases the "Time Under Tension" (TUT), which research associates with greater metabolic stress and muscle protein synthesis, factors linked to strength development[^1]. Consequently, weaknesses become more apparent and are felt more intensely. It's far easier to perform a quick push-up than to lower halfway down, hold with control, and then push back up. Try it yourself: the difference is palpable.

Anyone familiar with strength training knows this principle: lifting slowly with good form is more demanding than rushing through reps. Slowing down compels you to focus on technique, bringing awareness to precisely which muscles are activating, when, and how intensely. As you transition between muscle groups slowly, you feel the nuances of the movement far more acutely than if you were to speed through it.

## The Benefits of Slow

Moving slowly sharpens our focus on details, form, and technique, enhancing proprioception—our innate sense of body position and movement. It creates space to notice things we might otherwise miss—subtle misalignments in yoga, unconscious habits like clenching the jaw or furrowing the brow. This heightened awareness, stemming from more time for sensory feedback integration, allows us to find balance and make adjustments intentionally, rather than stumbling into them[^2].

Our brains, while powerful, have a limited processing bandwidth. Slowing down is a simple yet effective way to enhance the quality of our information processing. We can't instantly increase our brain's raw processing speed, but by slowing the input, we give ourselves more "time" relative to the action, allowing for deeper ingestion, analysis, synthesis, and assessment of our situation.

Achieving and maintaining a flow state often requires a balance between skill and challenge. High skill meets high challenge, fostering effortless attention and deep focus. Slowing down can recalibrate this balance, turning a familiar task into a more mindful challenge; indeed, research confirms that mindfulness cultivated through slow, deliberate movement is strongly linked to enhanced flow experiences and better nervous system regulation[^3].

## The Feel Good Sweet Spot

Beyond the technical benefits, I appreciate slow flow simply for how it *feels*. Moving deliberately feels better than rushing. There can still be moments of intensity or bursts of controlled speed, but the underlying quality isn't frantic. It's a dance, not a race. Slow movement embodies intentional control, the antithesis of anxious rushing, yet it remains challenging and engaging.

When we move with slow intention, we are in command, rather than merely reacting or flailing to get from point A to point B without regard for the journey. And while much of this post is about yoga, the principles apply to many aspects of life. Whether it's taking time to thoughtfully craft an email instead of firing off a hasty response, savouring a conversation rather than rushing to make your point, or deliberately working through a complex problem instead of jumping to the first solution—intentional slowness often yields better results and greater satisfaction.

Ultimately, it reinforces a timeless lesson: it truly is about the journey, not just the destination.
