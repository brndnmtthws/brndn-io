I've never liked the word "invention"; instead, I prefer the term _discovery_.
Nobody has ever invented anything–rather, sometimes we come upon discoveries,
and some people are lucky enough to figure out how to get money from them.

Whenever I think I'm clever and have somehow come upon a new idea, I have to
take a step back and remind myself that nearly everything has already been
tried or thought of at some point.

For any so-called "invention", you have to ask yourself: what makes this
particular thing a new creation? Everything in the universe is just an
arrangement of particles: atoms, electrons, protons, photons, neutrons, and all
the other subatomic particles (fermions, bosons, etc).

Who's to say that your "invention" couldn't be discovered by a million monkeys
on the particle arrangement equivalents of typewriters? I suppose you could
argue that the trick is knowing how to precisely arrange the matter into a form
that provides something useful, but is that the result of genius, or did you
succeed from random luck? In some cases, it might be a bit of both.

We're all products of our environment, and while I generally reject the concept
of genius, some people are indeed more skilled than others. If you consider
yourself a successful inventor, you may very well be nothing but an above
average monkey on the typewriter.

I've always found the concept of "intellectual property", or for that matter,
private property in general, to be entirely nonsensical. And while I'm not the
only person with this opinion, we currently live in a world where people use
violence to protect their arrangements of matter from other people because they
acquired that arrangement of matter before the other person discovered it, and
somehow that entitles them to use violence against the other person should they
decide that they want to take that arrangement of matter from someone else. We
construct institutions that use violence to enforce these rules by handing out
tokens to soldiers to carry out the violence in the name of some higher
authority.

Intellectual property is especially dubious in a digital world when there is
effectively zero scarcity; for practical purposes, we can make infinite copies
of bits, so why do we still need violence to enforce ownership of the bits?
Theoretically, you could discover the same arrangement of bits by applying the
monkeys-on-typewriters metaphor to any digital content, such as a video game or
digital film.

We have this concept of "private property" because we've decided (as a species)
that some people should have access to scarce things while others should not
because some have acquired more tokens than others. In nature, no such
thing exists. Private property is not natural; it does not exist in nature. If
a tiger is hungry and wants to eat you, it will just eat you. The tiger does
not have to check their bank account to ensure they can afford the cost of
purchasing you as a meal; they will have their dinner with or without the
requisite tokens.

Is private property bad? On its own, I think not. In many ways, private
property solves problems. I believe it can reduce violence–except when it
doesn't, like when countries go to war over who gets to extract the oil in the
ground over a specific region or somesuch. The funny thing about war is that it
boils down to different factions using violence to settle a dispute on who has
the monopoly on violence in a given region. The victor gets to rewrite history
in their favour.

As a side note, I don't have a problem with private property per se, or
intellectual property for that matter; I just don't think the government should
be in the business of using violence to protect private property or
businesses. You should be responsible for protecting your property, and
laws like the [DMCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act) are (in effect) remarkably stupid corporate welfare, which
amounts to taxpayer-funded subsidies for copyright holders. While
I'm not a fan of digital restrictions management (DRM), I would prefer
companies utilize DRM than use the government as their private security force.

All this is to say that whenever you think you have an original idea, maybe do
some internet research first to see how many other people have had the same
idea too, and upon doing so, you'll probably feel a bit deflated because you'll
likely realize very quickly that you aren't as clever as you think.
