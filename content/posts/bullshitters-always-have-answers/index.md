We often must judge others, such as when hiring, choosing who to work with, or selecting friends and partners. I find that there are two attributes most desirable in people I associate with: **authenticity** and **intelligence**.

There are two simple heuristics for detecting inauthentic people and genuinely smart ones, which I'll outline below.

## Detecting Inauthentic People

Inauthentic people are surprisingly easy to detect because they have a very difficult time using the phrase "I don't know." They always have answers, even when they shouldn't.

For example, watch how certain salespeople operate. A skilled but inauthentic salesperson will never admit ignorance about their product. Ask them a technical question they clearly don't know the answer to, and instead of saying "I don't know, but I can find out for you," they'll fabricate something plausible-sounding on the spot.

Similarly, many politicians demonstrate this behavior during interviews. When confronted with a difficult question, rather than admitting uncertainty or promising to research the topic, they often pivot to rehearsed talking points or reframe the question to suit their agenda.

**tl;dr:** Inauthentic people rarely say "I don't know" - they'll usually offer a confident but hollow answer instead.

## Detecting Genuinely Smart People

Identifying truly intelligent people is more challenging, but they typically demonstrate two key abilities:

* Smart people can break down complex topics into simple words that anyone can understand. Think of Richard Feynman explaining quantum physics with everyday analogies, or how the best doctors can explain complicated medical conditions without resorting to jargon.

* People who are both smart *and* authentic will give you truthful answers, even when uncomfortable. If you ask a difficult question where the honest answer might be awkward or unflattering, they won't sugarcoat or dodge. They respect your intelligence enough to give you the straight story, knowing you might not like it.

By contrast, someone who lacks expertise or intelligence but pretends otherwise often:

* Claims knowledge across an impossibly broad range of topics
* Relies heavily on field-specific jargon when explaining concepts
* Gets defensive or aggressive when asked follow-up questions
* Makes explanations more complex rather than simpler

**tl;dr:** Genuinely smart people can quickly explain complex topics to anyone in accessible terms. Those who hide behind jargon and complexity are often masking limited understanding.

## Prefer False Negatives to False Positives

These heuristics are simplistic but surprisingly effective in most situations. As a general rule, it's better to occasionally miss connecting with a good person (false negative) than to let an inauthentic person into your inner circle (false positive).

The cost of becoming entangled with someone who consistently misrepresents their knowledge or character can be significant in both professional and personal contexts. Being selective about who you trust and collaborate with isn't about elitism â€“ it's about protecting your time, energy, and wellbeing.
