One harmful myth perpetuated by the various cultural medias is the idea that
there exists some people in the world who have it easy, and aren't struggling
their way through life. I've always thought of myself as someone who has mostly
managed to fail upwards, which is probably the best outcome anyone can hope for.
Even the billionaires claim to be having a real tough time getting through every
day (although my advice to them would be to retire and let someone else get some
money, because you guys have enough and at this point you're just greedy).

An aphorism often (and perhaps falsely) attributed to the Buddha is "life is
suffering", which is one of those phrases that takes a while to sink in. In
Buddhism this is called _duhkha_, which (to quote Wikipedia) "refers to the
habitual experience of mundane life as fundamentally unsatisfactory and
painful".

Another fun one comes from William Shakespeare, in the form of what is probably
the most famous English soliloquy where Hamlet contemplates suicide (which I've shortened below, [read the full one here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_be,_or_not_to_be)):

> To be, or not to be, that is the question:
> 
> Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
> 
> The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
> 
> Or to take Arms against a Sea of troubles,
> 
> And by opposing end them: to die, to sleep
> 
> No more; and by a sleep, to say we end
> 
> The heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks
> 
> That Flesh is heir to? 'Tis a consummation
> 
> Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep,
> 
> To sleep, perchance to Dream; aye, there's the rub,
> 
> For in that sleep of death, what dreams may come,
> 
> When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
> 
> Must give us pause.

The lesson we can learn here is that suffering is a normal part of life. If you
don't feel as if you are suffering, then you're exceptional and abnormal (and
maybe [a psychopath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy)?). To have an
expectation that you shouldn't suffer is, at best, delusional.

I would go as far as to say that depression is a normal human response,
especially in a world full of suffering and cruelty. I'd even say that the whole
pharmaceutical industry built up around selling pills to increase the happy
chemicals in our brains is unnatural, and possibly harmful.

The reason I use the term _harmful_ to describe the myth of non-suffering is
that it implicitly forces us onto a [hedonic
treadmill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill), which seems to
mostly benefit those who are selling consumer goods. Perhaps with that knowledge
we can free ourselves from the treadmill (or at least limit our time spent on
it), once we've realized that buying a new gadget or whatever \<thing\> won't increase our
happiness.

It's liberating, in my opinion, to understand that it's okay to just enjoy life
as it is, without needing to constantly strive for more money or whatever it
might be. Just be present wherever you are now, no need to go to Burning Man or
hop on a plane to Cancun and burn a bunch of jet fuel just to learn that this is
as good as life gets.
