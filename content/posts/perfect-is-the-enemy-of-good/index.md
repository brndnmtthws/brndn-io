When someone asks me, "s'whattaya do?", I have a difficult time providing a
straight answer. These days, I suppose any of these would be acceptable
answers:

- Software Artisan
- Philosopher
- Amateur Blogger
- Author
- Investor
- Entrepreneur
- Human With Two Dogs
- Computer Person
- Techie
- Nerd
- Former Lyft Driver
- Autodidact
- Potato Farmer

Okay, okay, I will stop there. I could go on, but I'll spare you.

A lot of people get a little too attached to job titles and labels, but in
truth, you can put whatever you want on your résumé and there's nothing anyone
can do to stop you (they could certainly verify your employment history or
other facts, but you are free to identify with whichever profession you
choose).

For me personally, I suppose I just enjoy getting shit done. I am pretty good
at doing whatever needs to be done, and I generally have preferences in terms
of what to work on, but provided I'm physically capable of performing the task,
I can probably do a decent job of whatever.

I do, however, sometimes find myself seeking perfection in what I do, which I
think can be a huge roadblock to success for a lot of people.

## Perfection isn't Perfect

There are several problems with achieving perfection. The first problem is that
perfection is strictly unattainable. This is a goal that can never be achieved,
at least for any sufficiently complex problem. I suppose it might be possible
for the simplest of works: you could perhaps produce the most perfect 10x10
pixel image of the colour `#ffffff`, but I'll ignore such
arguments.

Even if you genuinely and confidently believe you can produce perfect work (you
can't), it's unlikely that anyone will be able to judge it as such. If you
_are_ the arbiter of greatness for whatever thing you're trying to produce, you
must be such a model of perfection yourself that no one else would even know
how to recognize your work as perfection.

## Embracing Imperfection

Diving deeper into the rabbit hole, you may begin to
notice something fascinating, which is that true masterpieces are chock full of
imperfection. Upon reflection you may feel the need to ask yourself "is
imperfection what makes a masterpiece?". This question, I think, is an
excellent one.

I'd argue that imperfection is a core feature of humanity, it's what separates
us from computers and makes people relatable. It's why computer-generated art
will never be real art, because (for example) part of what makes Van Gogh's art
so special is his own life story, in addition to his skills and technique.
Computer-generated art is nothing more than statistical mimicry, and while it's
just as useful as stock photography in marketing material or covering the walls
of a hotel lobby, it's not _really_ art in the proper sense. I think there's a
place in the world for computer-generated art, but its place is at the lowest
tier of art: ads, commercial real estate, propaganda, and the whole superhero
genre.

## Evoking an Emotional Reaction

Art is entirely subjective, but good art evokes an emotional reaction. For
example, while I don't like Taylor Swift's music, I respect her as an artist
because her songs are authentic, and it's evident from her performances that
she is deeply passionate about her work. She connects with her fans on a level
that can't be repackaged, rebundled, or reused for commercial purposes simply
because the mere act of doing so would cancel out any authenticity.

Taylor Swift evokes an emotional reaction within her Swifties that only makes
sense when you understand that Taylor Swift herself is imperfect, as are her
fans, and they connect over those imperfections. While I'm no expert on Taylor
Swift, a cursory glance at the lyrics of her songs suggests most of them are
about the trials and tribulations of being a girl in a world with too many
options on the dating apps. I can't relate to this because my experience with
the apps has been one of being ignored, ghosted, and rejected by most
women over what I assume is trivial nonsense, or simply a lack of attraction or
interest on their part. The apps have conditioned people to seek perfection,
which is unattainable.

Take this masterpiece from Taylor Swift, a song called "Cruel Summer", in which
Taylor complains about how hard it is dating boys:

> And it's new, the shape of your body  
> It's blue, the feeling I've got  
> And it's ooh, whoa, oh  
> It's a cruel summer  
> It's cool, that's what I tell 'em  
> No rules in breakable heaven  
> But ooh, whoa oh  
> It's a cruel summer  
> With you

She appears to be lamenting the fact that the man she's chosen doesn't equally
reciprocate her affection, or something to that effect. My suggestion to her is
to move on to the next one.

Even with some 8 billion people on this planet, none of them are perfect.
Perhaps the reason Taylor is so unhappy is that while she's learned to embrace
her _own_ imperfection, she hasn't learned to embrace the imperfection in
others.
