What exactly does it mean to *be present*? It’s a question I’ve written about
before, yet here I am again—writing another version of it. Maybe that’s the
point. Presence isn’t something you figure out once and move on from. It’s a
practice, a remembering.

It’s a tricky concept—hard to describe, slippery to pin down. Presence seems to
have layers. But maybe the best way to understand what presence *is* is to first
talk about what it *isn’t.*

## The Opposite of Presence

You’re not present when your mind is off somewhere else—replaying yesterday,
worrying about tomorrow, making grocery lists, or looping through anxieties
about what you’ve said, what you haven’t done, or what someone might be thinking
about you. You aren’t present when you’re worrying about what you *aren’t* doing
while failing to simply enjoy the moment you’re currently in.

The “monkey mind,” as it’s sometimes called, loves to swing from branch to
branch: laundry, groceries, texts, social media, self-doubt, plans, regrets,
imagined conversations. It’s endless. It’s funny, though, because your average
monkey is probably a lot better at being present than we are.

Maybe you’re walking and feel compelled to check your phone. Why? Your legs
don’t need LTE to work. The walk *is* the activity. The phone adds nothing to
it.

What if you just looked around and enjoyed the walk? You could—heaven
forbid—have a conversation with a stranger. Funny thing, this happened to me
just yesterday. A young man (I asked when he was born; he said 2006) asked me a
question on the street, and we ended up walking together for a while, having a
really nice conversation mostly about nothing.

We talked about how nobody talks anymore, how everyone’s just staring at their
phones. He asked if, before phones, people read newspapers on the subway. I
laughed and said, “Maybe. I can’t remember.” The truth is, I wish I could. He
must have assumed that I could remember the before times, and truly I cannot. We
said goodbye as he walked into a restaurant to have lunch with his friends, and
I’ll likely never see him again. But I won’t forget that conversation—something
that never would have occurred if either of us weren’t choosing to be present.

You see this everywhere in New York—people wandering around, phones out, staring
at maps, as if the city isn’t laid out on a giant grid. Manhattan is one of the
easiest places in the world to navigate. Count the blocks. Look up. The street
signs will tell you where you are. And if you get lost, just ask someone. People
are friendly, and most are willing to help.

And yet awareness isn’t found by fighting distraction—it’s rediscovered when we
stop trying to escape the moment we’re in.

When I see people walking around looking lost, I sometimes ask if they need
help. People are usually quite surprised when a random stranger offers help. I
also get asked for directions quite a bit; I suppose I look non-threatening.

People use maps on their phones not because they need to, but because it’s
comforting to have that glowing rectangle in hand. It feels safe. It’s what we
know. But it’s also what keeps us from *looking up.* It keeps us from looking
around, talking to strangers, and getting lost. I get that maybe you have
somewhere to be and a tight schedule, but just sometimes, try experiencing the
world around you and getting a little bit lost in it. There’s a comfort in
knowing when you do get lost, there’s probably someone there to help. If you
just ask, you’d be surprised how far out of their way someone might go to
help a stranger.

## So What Is Presence?

Presence is learning to just *be*—to exist in the literal present moment, right
where you are, not in some hypothetical future or idealized elsewhere. It’s
realizing that nothing in the material or virtual world matters as much as
whatever is happening right here and now.

It’s easy to fantasize about where to go on your next vacation, the new gadgets
you could acquire, or the bigger and better apartment. But what’s the point of
any of it if you can’t be content where you already are?

What if you learned to enjoy your city, your current possessions, your current
home?

If you can’t be happy *here* with what you already have, then you probably won’t
be happy *there* with an assortment of new things.

This is something I’ve written about before: the idea that if you can’t be happy
in your current life—with what you already have—you’ll just keep chasing
mirages. A bigger house, newer clothes, another upgrade, another trip. But can
you just exist with what’s in front of you? Can you learn to appreciate it? You
will never reach the end of the hedonic treadmill. No one has. Not even the
richest, most famous, most beautiful, most powerful, most educated, most
credentialed, most successful people ever. Not even the caricature of success
can get to the end of the hedonic treadmill.

Can you instead *double down on your own neighborhood*? Have you explored every
street around you? Met your neighbors? Visited the local spots you usually
ignore but walk past every day?

These are the kinds of things we do when we travel, yet we rarely do them at
home. Do you even know what’s within walking distance of your home? Have you
tried the local pizza place? Have you visited the local park?

## The Myth of Elsewhere

I used to believe travel was the ultimate symbol of cultural sophistication—the
great escape, the status badge of the well-rounded. But the more I traveled, the
more I realized: you can’t fly your way into fulfillment.

We are bombarded with ads and media that portray travel as the most glamorous,
fulfilling, joyful experience a person can have. TV shows, movies, books—you
name it—they all express the idea that travel is the epitome of human existence.
And it’s just _oh so good_ for the economy. This doesn’t match the reality of
travel: airports are crowded shopping malls, hotels are soulless places that
will never match the comfort of your own home. People who work in the tourism
industry are often overworked and underpaid, and are probably sick of giving the
exact same experience to the same people over and over again.

But it’s not the airplane that makes things magical; it’s your *attention.* Most
people don’t need more novelty—they need to learn how to *notice* again. You
probably enjoy travel because it’s the only time you focus on the present moment
rather than worrying about where you’re going next. You did all this planning
for the perfect vacation and now you're darn right you're going to enjoy it.

And yes, travel has its joys—but it also has its costs: the carbon, the
consumerism, the fact that nobody really likes tourists anyway. The GDP might go
up, but your sense of peace probably won’t.

Should you care about GDP? Numbers go up and down. So what? Having more never
made me feel better. Happiness is not a number—it’s the ability to sit still and
feel okay doing nothing at all. Having experienced the ups and downs of having
more and less money, I can say for sure that a bigger pile doesn’t bring bigger
happiness.

## Meditation, Mind Tricks, and Monkey Minds

If you’re new to meditation, it can sound abstract or even silly: sitting still,
eyes closed, hands in some mystical mudra. But meditation isn’t about posing
like a monk—it’s about *practice.* Contrary to what you may have learned from
Instagram or TikTok, it’s not a performance: it’s the intentional act of sitting
with your thoughts, trying to still the noise. It’s about doing it—showing up
for yourself—and being present in the meditation, not elsewhere.

There are tricks to it. Breathing exercises. Yoga āsanas. Running. Long bike
rides. Anything that puts your body in rhythm can become meditation once your
mind syncs to it. These tricks can help you focus and quiet your mind—they’re
useful tools, not crutches.

Some gurus might claim to have found enlightenment through meditation and claim
to exist in a constant state similar to that of an LSD trip (as Ram Dass’s guru
apparently was[^1]). Whether their story is true or not (I have my doubts),
attaining the ultimate enlightenment is not the goal. The goal is simply to move
things in the right direction. Having unattainable goals is a trap and a
precursor to failure and suffering.

Music can do it. Repetition can do it. A mantra can do it. Anything that narrows
attention to a single point—one phrase, one sound, one breath—quieting the rest
of the static. For me, I like all of these, especially the āsanas.

It’s a bit like EMDR therapy, where your eyes follow a moving hand and, somehow,
the motion helps unstick emotions. It’s not magic; it’s focus. Focus opens
doors. EMDR isn’t new-age nonsense either—it works. Many people swear by it. But
it’s not the only way to achieve presence.

Therapy, introspection, meditation—all can help you return to presence.
Will they necessarily solve all your problems? Unlikely. They may not alleviate
your past traumas. And while I find some people make too liberal use of the word
*trauma* to describe every inconvenience, every injustice they’ve felt, being
present can’t necessarily make your sad feels go away. I’m talking about sitting
with whatever *is*—the hard stuff, the real stuff—and not letting it own you.
Detach from it, and let it go, so it can’t own you.

Eventually, all of these techniques come down to the same thing: bringing the
mind home.

## Presence in Practice

For me, presence is something I try to practice every day. It’s not
theoretical—it’s deliberate. When I’m working, I try to actually *work.* One
task at a time. Not multitasking, not toggling between windows or checking the
news mid-sentence. Multitasking is the antithesis of presence. Humans aren’t
built for it.

Presence is choosing to zero in on one thing and do it well. It’s remembering
that this moment—right here, right now—might be the best it ever is. That we
could die tomorrow. That every breath is a gift. It’s being grateful for the
moment, for the good things you do have, and for the people (or dogs, in my
case) you love.

You have to learn to sit with yourself, breathe in and out, and enjoy the
simplicity of it. Let the thoughts come, then gently push them aside.

Enjoy your chair. Enjoy your coffee—the warmth of the cup, the stillness between
sips. Enjoy the boredom. Appreciate the mundane things around you.

Yes—*boredom.* What a gift it is to be bored. Great things happen when we’re
bored. Boredom is not a void; it’s a clearing, a space where creativity sneaks
in. But most of us can’t handle it. We reach for our phones, our scrolls, our
dopamine drips.

Delete the apps. Turn off notifications. Uninstall the sludge. All of it is
engineered to pull you out of yourself. It’s the opposite of presence.

## A Letter to My Younger Self

If I could talk to a younger version of myself, I’d tell him to stop
overthinking it. I used to expect results quickly—to meditate and feel
enlightened in a week, to make changes and see instant rewards. But that’s not
how this works.

Presence takes practice. You don’t master it—you *notice* it. You fail, then
notice again. Step one, I suppose, is simply recognizing when you aren’t
present.

The first step is awareness. Noticing when you’re doing something that doesn’t
serve you. Spending money you shouldn’t. Planning to spend money you don’t have.
Fantasizing about the next upgrade. Letting your brain spiral into comparison or
craving. Worrying about things that haven’t happened. Lamenting over things that
already have.

You have to throw yourself a rope. No one’s coming to save you. Most people
don’t stick around when things fall apart—they scatter. Don’t count on rescue;
cultivate resilience. Be your own hero; save yourself.

## The Ritual of Returning

For an hour—or two, if I’m lucky—every day, I get to use my body as a tool for
clearing the mind. It’s moving meditation. In Warrior III or Half Moon, there’s
no room for intrusive thoughts. You can’t doomscroll upside down in a handstand.

Yoga can be dialed up or down depending on your mood. You can make it as easy or
as challenging as you want. There are endless variations and levels of
difficulty depending on your experience, goals, and needs on any given day.

Focusing on your breath, movement, and alignment—the āsanas are a way of using
your body to control your mind. Balancing effort and ease, you make it what you
want. Plus, it *just feels really good* to flex, flow, stretch, bend, twist,
hold, and *release.* Top it all off and round it out by lying like a corpse for
ten minutes.

Yoga, for me, is a daily ritual that brings me back to the here and now. If I
skip it, I feel off. When I practice consistently, I feel whole. It’s not about
flexibility or aesthetics—it’s about presence. I don’t do it for the Instagram
points; I do it for the peace. Granted, I suppose in some ways it makes me a
hypocrite to write about it on my blog, but I’m okay with that.

Yoga might not be your thing. That’s fine. It could be running, painting,
woodworking, playing music, reading, writing, tending plants, sitting on a bench
people-watching. The form doesn’t matter. The focus does. And even more
importantly, the consistency. Do it not because you think it impresses others;
do it because it makes you feel whole.

It’s not about competition. There are no trophies in yoga class. The only prize
is presence. The people who show up just for themselves—the quiet ones, the
steady ones—those are the ones who get it. They’re not trying to perform.
They’re just *being.*

That’s the whole point.

## Being a Human Being

Presence isn’t about becoming something new. It’s about returning to what you
already are. It’s learning to stop outsourcing your peace to the next
notification, the next trip, the next plan.

The monkey mind, perhaps, isn’t so bad after all, because monkeys are just doing
what they do best: being themselves—swinging from branches, playing in the
leaves, mating, sleeping.

Try doubling down on the here and now. Forget the past. Stop hallucinating about
the future. Sit. Breathe. Notice. Repeat.

Be here. Be human. That’s enough.
