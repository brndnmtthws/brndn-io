When most people contemplate _technology_, their minds immediately conjure sci-fi
spectacles: humanoid robots, sentient AI, and interplanetary travel. But technology
extends far beyond these futuristic tropes. At its essence, technology represents
our methodical manipulation of the environment to serve human needs. Through this
fundamental lens, cities themselves emerge as perhaps humanity's most sophisticated
and consequential technological achievement.

![A future no one asked for.](cover.png "It's not the future we wanted, but what we got. The backward cars and other weirdness are good examples of why we are not 'AI' yet.")

Technology, properly defined, involves applying scientific knowledge to solve practical
problems. Cities embody this process on a grand scale—they represent the culmination
of millennia of continuous problem-solving. From the first permanent settlements along
fertile river valleys to the sprawling metropolises of today, urban environments have
evolved as complex systems addressing fundamental human needs: shelter, security,
resource distribution, waste management, transportation, and social connection.

I'm an unabashed urban enthusiast. Cities remain criminally underappreciated as
humanity's most remarkable technological innovation. While we readily celebrate
individual inventions—smartphones, vaccines, or electric vehicles—we rarely acknowledge
the city itself as a comprehensive technological system. Ancient Rome's aqueducts,
sewers, and multi-story apartment buildings represented engineering marvels that enabled
unprecedented population density. Medieval city walls and defensive architecture solved
security problems. The grid systems of planned cities from Teotihuacan to Manhattan
created navigable order from potential chaos.

## The Car-Shaped Problem

If you've followed my writing, you've likely realized this represents yet another
entry in my ongoing critique of automobile dependency. A paradigm shift in urban design
philosophy is finally gaining momentum, particularly among younger generations who've
recognized the profound limitations of car-centric development patterns and suburban
sprawl.

Evidence increasingly demonstrates that automobiles represent a suboptimal solution
for urban mobility. Cars deliver extraordinarily inefficient transportation—a typical
vehicle weighing 4,000 pounds to move a single 150-pound human being represents an
almost comically wasteful energy proposition. They're demonstrably dangerous, killing
approximately 1.35 million people globally each year. And their environmental impact
threatens the very biosphere that sustains our existence.

The automobile-centric development that dominated 20th-century urban planning represents
a historical anomaly rather than an inevitable evolution. Cities thrived for thousands
of years before cars, designed at human scale for walking. The medieval European cities
that tourists flock to photograph weren't designed for pedestrians out of some
romanticized notion—they were built that way because it worked. The post-WWII suburban
experiment, fueled by cheap oil and government subsidies, created unprecedented
dependencies on private vehicle ownership while dissolving the urban fabric that
supported community and efficient resource use.

## Reimagining Urban Technology

I acknowledge my climate pessimism—at this juncture, humanity likely faces unavoidable
geoengineering interventions, having crossed several critical thresholds. The
atmospheric carbon clock continues ticking while emissions metrics trend in alarming
directions. Long-term species survival may necessitate stratospheric aerosol injection
or massive carbon capture deployment, but those represent topics for another discussion.

Nevertheless, substantial hope remains for dramatically improving quality of life through
urban redesign. Rather than subsidizing failing automobile manufacturers or expanding
highway systems that induce further demand, we could redirect resources toward rehabilitating
our cities as genuinely human environments. We can transform urban centers into places
where people genuinely want to live, work, and engage—places that foster human flourishing
without the constant intrusion of noisy, dangerous, space-consuming vehicles.

The transformation requires reimagining public space allocation. Consider that in most
American cities, 50-70% of urban land is dedicated to cars through roads and parking—an
astonishing commitment to a single transportation mode. We could reclaim substantial
portions of this space for tree canopies that reduce urban heat islands, public plazas
that foster community interaction, dedicated cycling infrastructure that enables safe
active transportation, and efficient public transit systems that move people more
effectively than private vehicles ever could.

Cities that have already implemented such transformations demonstrate their viability.
Copenhagen's bicycle superhighways, Barcelona's superblock model, and Paris's recent
rapid transformation under Mayor Anne Hidalgo illustrate how quickly urban environments
can evolve when political will aligns with sound urban design principles. These cities
aren't sacrificing economic vitality or mobility—they're enhancing both while simultaneously
improving environmental outcomes and quality of life.

I harbor no illusions about the challenges. Entrenched financial interests, cultural
attachments to automobility, and institutional inertia create formidable obstacles.
The transition won't materialize overnight, nor will it proceed without resistance.
But cities have continuously reinvented themselves throughout human history, adapting
to changing needs, technologies, and values.

As our most sophisticated and consequential technological achievement, cities remain
our best hope for addressing climate change, resource constraints, and quality of life
concerns simultaneously. The most sustainable, efficient, and potentially delightful
human habitats have always been thoughtfully designed cities. By recognizing urban
environments as technology—systems we can deliberately modify and improve—we unlock
possibilities for reimagining our collective future.

One can, indeed, dream. But more importantly, one can advocate, organize, and participate
in the evolution of these remarkable human inventions we call cities.
