If a “true” self exists at all, it probably only appears when no one is watching.

The rest of the time, we’re adapting to context. At work, we perform the professional self. With friends, we’re relaxed, funny, interesting. With family, something else entirely. Online, where the audience is abstract and potentially infinite, we often project an idealized version of ourselves—the highlight reel.

The obvious question is how far this performance drifts from whatever we might call a “true” self.

One answer is simple enough. If there *is* a true self, it’s probably who we are when we’re not performing for anyone. Alone. Anonymous. With nothing to gain and no one to impress.

When you’re alone, do you clean the dishes right away, or let them sit in the sink? Do you dress for comfort, or style? Do you extend the same small courtesies—manners, patience, restraint—when no one is around to bear witness?

Much of our lives is spent performing for audiences, real or imagined. Sometimes those audiences exist only in our heads. You might worry about what strangers think of you as you move through the world, adjusting your posture, your tone, your behavior accordingly. You might worry about whether your parents would approve. But that imagined audience rarely exists. Most of those strangers aren’t thinking about you at all. They’re preoccupied with their own internal performances, wondering how *they* are being perceived. Your parents are probably too busy wondering whether they did any of it right.

This is where the idea of “authenticity” starts to wobble. If you are consciously trying to appear authentic, what exactly is authentic about that? We’re authentic precisely when we’re not trying to be.

Perhaps we seek to be seen and judged because invisibility feels threatening. To be unobserved can feel like nonexistence. But if we are always orienting ourselves toward an audience—real or imagined—there’s no space left to simply be. In that state, performance slowly crowds out presence.

Solitude is one thing. Making the choice to be alone when we want to can be quite satisfying when we need it. But being alone and invisible is something else, and to most of us it feels downright awful. We need to be seen, but we want to be seen in a certain light. When the light is shining, our masks go on, and we start to dance.

Occasionally the mask slips. Maybe you lose your temper. Maybe you think you’re alone when you’re not, and suddenly realize the performance—the mask—has to snap back into place. These moments are jarring precisely because they expose the gap between who we are and who we present ourselves as.

I suspect that the urge to “find ourselves” is often backwards. There may be nothing to find at all. The moment we stop performing is the moment whatever is underneath is allowed to surface. Not because it’s noble or optimized or impressive, but because it’s unfiltered.

For me, that unfiltered self cleans the dishes immediately (or, at least, puts them in the dishwasher). But he also leaves the laundry sitting in the dryer far longer than he should (often until it’s time for the next load). Even then, I sometimes catch myself imagining my late mother’s voice, lecturing me about folding clothes while they’re still warm. The audience lingers longer than we’d like to admit.

But those quiet moments—unobserved, unshared, undocumented—are the closest thing I know to authenticity. There’s no reason to perform.
