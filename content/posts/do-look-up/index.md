There's a trope in New York City that you can identify tourists from their propensity to walk around staring up at the tall buildings. This isn't necessarily meant to be interpreted literally, but rather it's more about the fact that the tourists are fully present—taken aback by everything to look at, much of which is in the upward direction depending on where you are in the city.

I remember the first time I visited Manhattan, about a decade ago, and I felt overwhelmed at the time by the city: the lights, the sights, the sounds, everything happening all around all at once. It's overwhelming to the senses, whether you look up, down, or sideways.

In South Korea, they install pedestrian lights on the ground to aid people who walk around staring at their phones.

## The Wisdom of Wonder

The tourists get something right, though: they look around. They look up, down, sideways, and stare at all there is to see. They take it in, experience what's in front of them, and exist in the reality before them at that moment. Some of those who live here will walk around staring at their phones, scrolling through Instagram or TikTok on the subway, refreshing constantly while the vibrant reality passes by right in front of them.

When we avoid eye contact with strangers and disconnect from our surroundings, we might miss the experience of one of the greatest cities in one of the greatest times to be alive according to a variety of metrics.

## The Evolution of Distraction

Internet-connected mobile devices and social media platforms aren't solely responsible for our diverted attention. This pattern started long before we had cellular devices. It began with the radio, continued with television, and now it's reached a level of ubiquity and options that is well described by the [brilliant Bo Burnham](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1BneeJTDcU), who rightfully [won numerous awards and accolades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo_Burnham:_Inside#Accolades) for this fine piece of work.

## Finding Balance in a Digital World

In the age of AI advancement and [scientism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientism), it's refreshing to see people who manage to walk around New York City looking up, but it doesn't have to be only the tourists who take a moment to enjoy their surroundings. I won't pretend I don't look at my phone sometimes, but I'm trying to be more conscious and aware of how engaging these pocket-sized devices can be, and how they sometimes interrupt our connection with the physical world by competing for our attention.

## Technological Reflection

The proliferation of ad-based media (which includes news outlets, social platforms, and everything in between) presents significant questions about attention and values. Similarly, other technological developments like industrial agriculture, transportation systems, corporate structures, and powerful innovations have created both opportunities and challenges throughout history.

The discourse around technology has evolved, and while I appreciate innovation's potential, it feels as if the pendulum sometimes swings too far when new technologies prioritize engagement over genuine enhancement of human experience. The current incentives combined with hype cycles and occasional misuse of terminology can leave us craving simplicity rather than complexity.

## Reclaiming Attention

Every time I see a website prompting me to install an app, or encounter self-checkout systems with complex interfaces, I'm reminded of the value of occasional digital disconnection. Perhaps we could all benefit from periodic breaks from our devices—moments when we can look up, around, and fully engage with the remarkable world surrounding us.

The tourists' upward gaze isn't just about seeing tall buildings—it's about being present, curious, and open to wonder. And that's something worth emulating, no matter how long we've lived in a place.
