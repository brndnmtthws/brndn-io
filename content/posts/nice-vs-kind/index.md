Kindness and niceness aren't the same thing. This may sound like I'm splitting
hairs, but once you notice the difference it's hard to unsee. I first bumped
into this idea through the New York stereotype—how people who don't live here
love to say New Yorkers are rude. I don't buy it. New Yorkers just have a
different concept of what counts as rude.

What I see most days is that New Yorkers are kind, just not especially nice.
There's a difference between a city full of "how are you today?" and a city full
of people who will yank you out of a turning taxi's path with a brusque "watch
it." One is smooth; the other is useful.

If I had to draw the line, niceness is the choreography—please and thank you, a
smile, a little chat about the weather. It makes the social machinery run
without friction, and there's nothing wrong with that, but it can also be all
superficial surface fluff. Kindness, on the other hand, is the motive force. It's the part that
actually cares whether you're okay. Niceness can be a costume. Kindness can be a
hassle. Niceness is charm that sometimes masks entitlement; kindness is a
genuine concern for others.

## In Practice

In Manhattan, where you pass a thousand strangers before lunch, the
politeness routine falls away because everyone's in motion and the currency here
is time. Blocking the sidewalk, five-abreast at a museum pace—that's peak
disrespect. Cutting through the small talk so the line at Duane Reade moves?
That's a kind of respect, too. Sometimes you give up your subway seat to someone
who needs it, but you don't need to exchange words or even smile.

There's also the "nice guy" stereotype—politeness with a price tag. It's not
kindness; it's a tactic. Niceness expects a return. Kindness doesn't
invoice. If a friend asks to borrow money, it's nice to float the loan and
expect it back; it's kind to help without turning the relationship into a
ledger. Kindness given freely beats niceness on credit. You can't use niceness
as a form of payment to get things you want from people.

To be clear, I think the nice guy stereotype itself has been beaten into
caricature by the gender wars. I'm not trying to pile onto that. You can
certainly be a genuinely nice guy (or gal for that matter) and that's not a bad
thing. Sometimes nice is actually just nice, and that's fine.

## And What About You?

I've been doing a quiet self-audit on this front. Where am I actually helpful,
and where am I just doing what makes me feel like a good person? I love to sit
with a book in the little garden near my place—dogs at my feet, the same
volunteers tending the garden beds and picking up trash, the same regulars
passing through.

Being kind (at least for me) requires overcoming my own insecurities and
anxieties. Being kind is _hard_—it requires exiting my comfort zone and
risking rejection (not everyone _wants_ to be helped).

Sometimes at the garden, I nod and keep to myself. Other days I remember what it
felt like to be the invisible person and I try to be the opposite—ask how
someone's doing, offer a hand, put a stray compliment to work ("that jacket
looks great on you").

Sometimes I make mistakes, too—doing things that aren't kind, and are, in fact,
_mean_. The jokes I toss off without thinking, the small ways I
might make somebody's day worse instead of better—I'm trying to notice those and
cut them off before they land. Step one, really, is subtracting harm. Becoming
aware of the moments when I say or do something without adequately considering about how it
might affect others is a skill that needs to be developed.

## Quid Pro Quo or Quid Pro No?

Part of what helps is not treating kindness like a transaction with a
scoreboard. If I'm kind so that you'll like me, I'm already off the mark. The
old Stoic line is as sharp as ever: some things are in my control—what I do,
what I say—and some things aren't—what you think of me, whether you say thanks.
I can control the gesture, not the reaction[^1]. And the Bhagavad Gita puts it in
a single sentence I wish I'd absorbed years ago: I have a right to my actions,
not to the fruits of them[^2]. Do the work; let the outcome go.

Call it
non-attachment if you like—the practice of showing up without clinging to how it
turns out. Psychologists who study non-attachment describe it as a flexible way
of relating to experience without grasping or suppression, and they've found
it's linked to healthier psychological and social functioning[^3]. That tracks:
when I'm not busy worrying about the return on investment (ROI) of my "good
deed," I usually do a better deed entirely.

Here's the funny thing: the evidence suggests that kindness works better than we
expect, even when no one applauds. A meta-analysis of twenty-seven
experiments—more than four thousand people—found that doing kind acts gives a
reliable, small-to-medium lift to the giver's well-being[^4].

It's not complicated stuff,
either; start small with doable things. In another study, people with significant
anxiety or depression were randomly assigned to different practices; the group
doing small, regular acts of kindness wound up feeling more socially connected
(and generally better) than groups practicing some standard cognitive-behavioral
tools[^5]. That one result alone has been a nudge for me to stop overthinking and
just help.

We're poor judges of impact, which perhaps stems from a certain pessimism or
negative bias. In a series of field and lab studies—buying a stranger hot
chocolate in a park, small gifts in controlled settings—givers consistently
underestimated how much the gesture would matter. Recipients felt warmer and
happier than the giver predicted[^6]. So yes: if they don't say thank you, the
kindness still counts, and it probably landed harder than you think.

## Pay It Forward

There's also a spillover effect that makes me a little optimistic about people
and how far a little kindness can go. Cooperative behavior has been shown to
ripple through social networks—sometimes out to "three degrees" of separation—so
your generosity to me today can show up later in how I treat somebody you'll
never meet[^7]. No scoreboard, no strings—just the thing that helps, and then
keeps helping.

If kindness is the positive project, the baseline is simpler: first, do no harm.
Ahimsa, the principle of non-violence, is broader than
not hitting people; it's a refusal to injure when you can avoid it—including
with your mouth, your actions, your timing, your tweets. It's a decent way to move
through a city: less needless snark, less sidewalk sabotage, less weaponizing of
other people's time. First, do no harm—ahimsa as everyday etiquette[^8]. It begins with yourself and extends outward. In other words, give yourself a break.

## Be Kind, Be Nice

All of which loops me back to New York and the original distinction. The world
is not suffering from a shortage of "nice." TV anchors are nice.
Customer-service scripts are nice. Being mean is easy. Being nice is easier.
Being kind, repeatedly and without a scoreboard, is the hard and worthwhile
thing.

I'm not claiming to be good at it. I'm saying I want to be the person who
notices, who offers, who helps, and then moves on without waiting for the
receipt to print. Kindness is less about polishing the interaction and more
about relieving a burden. If I can do that a little more often—on the subway, in
the garden, in the line at CVS—I'll take it as progress.
