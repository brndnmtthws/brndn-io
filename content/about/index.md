# About Brenden Matthews

My Face
{{< />}}
----------
I'm an entrepreneur and open source software developer who's worked with a number of startups over the past 15 years. I have helped scale 3 separate $1B+ valuation companies through various stages of hypergrowth, and I've also started a few companies of my own. I grew up in Canada, and moved to San Francisco in 2009, but now I live in New York City. This page contains a non-exhaustive list of some other things I've done.

These days I'm mostly interested in building new companies. I am very
interesting in finding ways to match talent with opportunity. Talent is
everywhere, but opportunity remains scarce for most people.

## As a professional

I've worked at a number of different startups including Airbnb, Mesosphere
(now known as D2IQ), Braze, and others.

At Airbnb I worked on the data infrastructure team. I contributed to a number of open source projects during that time, including the [Apache Mesos](https://mesos.apache.org/) project which I became a PMC member of.

After Airbnb, I joined Mesosphere to continue working with Mesos. I helped build the original sales team and laid the foundation for the service organization.

## Open Source

I've contributed to a long list of open source projects over the years. I am probably most well known for creating a project called [Conky](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky). Today I have more than 100 public GitHub projects. Here are some of my more popular projects:

* [Conky](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky), a system monitor for X
* [optimal-buy-cbpro](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/optimal-buy-cbpro), a Coinbase Pro bot for dollar cost averaging
* [cracking-the-coding-interview-rust](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/cracking-the-coding-interview-rust), solutions to Cracking the Coding Interview problems written in Rust
* [The HODLer Manifesto](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/hodlermanifesto), a short manifesto on HODLing
* [tweet-delete](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/tweet-delete), a Twitter bot for deleting your tweets
* [mother-of-dragons](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/mother-of-dragons), a miner management tool for DragonMint/Innosilicon mining hardware
* [labhub](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/labhub), a bot for integrating GitLab CI with GitHub open source projects

## Adventures

I've climbed a few mountains, ran marathons, and done some long distance cycling ([randonneur style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randonneuring)). Here's a few examples:

* In 2016 I biked from SF to NYC unassisted in 27 days. I recorded a [daily video log on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfHJt4o9-rmCH1J_DTVoNxrnJiaPUNg_O)
* I raced the Wolfpack Hustle Crash race before the 2012 LA marathon, crashed 1 mile before the finish line, and then ran the marathon in under 4 hours
* I biked to the summit of [Mauna Kea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauna_Kea), a volcano in Hawaii, unassisted, which might be the longest continuous vertical climb in the world (from sea to summit is over 13,000ft in vertical gain)
