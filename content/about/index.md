Hi! I’m Brenden Matthews. I’m a software engineer, author, artist, and
entrepreneur who likes partnering with startups. Three of the startups I’ve
worked with have gone on to exceed a $1B valuation, and I’ve also launched my
own ventures.

Originally from Canada, I’ve lived and worked in San Francisco and New York.
This site is where I publish essays that mix engineering, entrepreneurship, and
creative work, with the occasional personal journal entry.

If you’re curious what to expect, the short version is:

- Building and scaling software (especially infrastructure and distributed systems)
- Rust, systems programming, and open source
- Photography and other creative projects
- Adventures, endurance sports, and staying healthy

## Start Here

If you’re new, here are a few posts to start with:

- [The Value of Tools](/posts/the-value-of-tools) — Tools, leverage, and value creation
- [Growth vs. Grind](/posts/growth-vs-grind) — Sustainable ambition
- [The 10x Engineer Is a Myth: It's More Like 100x](/posts/the-10x-engineer-is-a-myth-its-more-like-100x) — Power laws in software and teams
- [Cities Are Technology](/posts/cities-are-technology) — Urbanism, infrastructure, and the car-shaped problem
- [Analogue Joy in a Digital World](/posts/analogue-joy) — Film, physical media, and digital minimalism

I’ve worked at and with [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/), [Mesosphere
(D2IQ)](https://d2iq.com/), and [Braze](https://www.braze.com/), plus earlier
roles in Canada and California.

A quick sketch of that path:

- Started in Canada building instrumentation for oil and gas exploration
- Moved into mobile telecom optimization in California (custom databases, an RPC
  system, and parsers for Ericsson LTE data; later acquired)
- At Airbnb, focused on data infrastructure and open source: Apache Mesos (PMC),
  Chronos, SmartStack, and Kafka
- Helped scale Mesosphere, supporting sales and services as it grew
- After Braze, leaned into entrepreneurship and writing, including Rust books

## Speaking & Media

I’ve spoken at events like [QCon](https://qconsf.com/), [All Things
Open](https://allthingsopen.org/), MesosCon, ContainerCon, and LinuxCon. I’ve
also been interviewed on podcasts and in articles:

- [SE Radio](https://se-radio.net/2025/03/se-radio-659-brenden-matthews-on-idiomatic-rust/) – Discussed "Idiomatic Rust"
- [Rustacean Station](https://rustacean-station.org/episode/brenden-matthews-idiomatic-rust/) – Also about "Idiomatic Rust"
- [Rustacean Station](https://rustacean-station.org/episode/051-brenden-matthews/) – About "Code Like a Pro in Rust"

## Open Source

I’ve contributed to many open-source projects. Some of my own notable projects
include:

- [Conky](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky), a system monitor
- [ThetaGang](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/thetagang), an options trading strategy
- [dryoc](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/dryoc), a pure-Rust cryptography library
- [cracking-the-coding-interview-rust](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/cracking-the-coding-interview-rust), Rust solutions to coding problems
- [genserver](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/genserver), an Elixir-style GenServer in Rust
- And [more on GitHub](https://github.com/brndnmtthws)

## Writing

I’ve written books and plenty of blog content. Some highlights:

- [Code Like a Pro in Rust](https://www.manning.com/books/code-like-a-pro-in-rust?utm_source=brendenm&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=book_matthews_code_9_22_21&a_aid=brendenm&a_bid=3eb61509)
- [Idiomatic Rust](https://www.manning.com/books/idiomatic-rust?utm_source=brendenm&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=book_matthews2_rust_6_6_23&a_aid=brendenm&a_bid=cc069fd9&chan=mm_github)

## Photography

I enjoy photography, especially analogue photography (street, portraits, and
printmaking). Images on this blog are free to use under [CC0
1.0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). [Here’s one
example](/posts/commercial-real-estate).

## Videography

I have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/aeouuuuuuuuuuuuuuu) and
used to [stream on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/letsmakestuff). I even made a
brief appearance in a WeWork documentary on Hulu.

Some older videos are still up, though they can feel outdated. They remain
because some might still enjoy them.

## Adventures

I’ve tackled big challenges:

- Biked from SF to NYC unassisted in 27 days, recording a [daily YouTube vlog](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfHJt4o9-rmCH1J_DTVoNxrnJiaPUNg_O)
- Raced the Wolfpack Hustle Crash Race before the 2012 LA marathon, crashed, then still finished the marathon in under four hours
- Biked from sea level to Mauna Kea’s 13,000+ ft summit
- Rode from SF to Chico, then through the northern Sierra and up Mount Shasta
