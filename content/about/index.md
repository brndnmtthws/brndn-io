I'm a serial entrepreneur, software engineer, artist, and adventurer who's
worked with a number of startups over the past 20 years. I've helped scale 3
separate $1B+ valuation companies through various stages of hypergrowth, and
I've started a few companies of my own. I grew up in Canada, moved to San
Francisco in 2009, and spent some years in New York. This page contains a
non-exhaustive list of some things I've done.

These days I'm mostly interested in building new companies. Specifically, I'm
looking for ways to match talent with opportunity. Talent is everywhere, but
opportunity remains scarce for most.

## As a Professional

I've worked at a number of different startups including [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/), Mesosphere
(now known as [D2IQ](https://d2iq.com/)), [Braze](https://www.braze.com/), and others.

My first startup was a Canadian oil and gas company that manufactured instrumentation for oil and gas exploration. Specifically, we created tools for measuring pressure, temperature, and other metrics within oil and gas wells. The instrumentation was designed to withstand extremely high pressures, temperatures, and corrosive environments for months at a time.

In 2009 I joined a company in California that provided telecom companies with mobile network telemetry tools, and also offered network optimization services. There I created a custom database that was highly optimized for our workloads, built our own RPC system, and wrote the first parser for Ericsson LTE layer 2 network data. That company was later acquired by Tektronix (after I left).

In 2013 I joined Airbnb where I worked on the data infrastructure team. I contributed to a number of open source projects during that time, including the [Apache Mesos](https://mesos.apache.org/) project which I became a PMC member of. I also contributed to Chronos, SmartStack, Kafka, and other projects during my time at Airbnb.

In 2015 I joined Mesosphere to continue working with Mesos. Mesosphere was founded by 2 of my Airbnb teammates, as well as a Twitter employee (the creator of Mesos itself). I helped scale the company, build the sales team, and laid the foundation for the service organization.

In 2018 I joined Braze, but decided to leave after just 6 months to start a new company.

After several years going HAM at [wantrepreneuring](/tags/wantrepreneur/), I've
decided to spend my time on things with a higher likelihood of success than
moonshot startups.

These days I mainly collect money from investments, but I'm always open to
interesting opportunities if they're worth my while.

## Public Speaking

I've given talks at a number of different events including conferences, meetups, and private engagements. Some of the conferences I've spoken at in the past are [QCon](https://qconsf.com/), [All Things Open](https://allthingsopen.org/), MesosCon, ContainerCon, LinuxCon, and others.

## Open Source

I've contributed to a long list of open source projects over the years. I am probably most well known for creating a project called [Conky](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky). Today I have more than 150 public GitHub projects, 2 of which have over 1,000 stars, 6 with over 100. Here are some of my projects:

- [Conky](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky), a system monitor for X
- [ThetaGang](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/thetagang), an implementation of "the wheel", an options trading strategy
- [dryoc](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/dryoc), a pure-Rust general purpose cryptography library, based on the libsodium (which is based on the legendary [NaCl from djb](https://nacl.cr.yp.to/))
- [cracking-the-coding-interview-rust](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/cracking-the-coding-interview-rust), solutions to interview problems from the book "Cracking the Coding Interview", in Rust
- [genserver](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/genserver), an [Elixir GenServer](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/GenServer.html) inspired Rust library
- [optimal-buy-cbpro](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/optimal-buy-cbpro), a Coinbase Pro trading bot for dollar cost averaging into "cryptos", if you like that sort of thing
- [The HODLer Manifesto](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/hodlermanifesto), a short manifesto on HODLing
- [tweet-delete](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/tweet-delete), a Twitter bot for deleting your tweets

- [labhub](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/labhub), a bot for integrating GitLab CI with GitHub open source projects

## Writings

I've published many things over the years, in addition to the content on this
blog, and much of it has been lost to internet rot. Here are a few things you
can still find:

- [Code Like a Pro in Rust](https://www.manning.com/books/code-like-a-pro-in-rust?utm_source=brendenm&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=book_matthews_code_9_22_21&a_aid=brendenm&a_bid=3eb61509), my Rust programming book
- [Programming in Rust: the good, the bad, the ugly.](https://hackernoon.com/programming-in-rust-the-good-the-bad-the-ugly-d06f8d8b7738)

## Photography

I've always had an interest in photography, and my blog features plenty of my
original photography. You are welcome to use the imagery under the terms of the
[CC0 1.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) if you'd
like, which permits you to do whatever you want with it (no attribution
required). [Here's one example of some photos](/posts/commercial-real-estate).

## Videography

I have a neglected [YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/aeouuuuuuuuuuuuuuu), and I occasionally [streamed on
Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/letsmakestuff) in the past but I lack the passion these days.
Notably, my work was featured in a documentary about WeWork on Hulu.

Some of my YouTube content feels a bit cringe to me now, but I leave it out there anyway because some people seem to enjoy it ðŸ™‚

## Adventures

I've climbed mountains, ran marathons, and done some long distance cycling ([randonneur style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randonneuring)). Here's a few examples:

- I biked from SF to NYC unassisted in 27 days. I recorded a [daily video log on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfHJt4o9-rmCH1J_DTVoNxrnJiaPUNg_O)
- I raced the Wolfpack Hustle Crash Race before the 2012 LA marathon, crashed 1 mile before the finish line, made it back to the start of the marathon, and then finished the marathon in under 4 hours
- I biked to the summit of [Mauna Kea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauna_Kea), a volcano in Hawaii, unassisted. The climb to Mauna Kea's summit might be the longest continuous vertical climb in the world (from sea to summit is over 13,000ft in vertical gain)
- I biked from SF to Chico, through the northern Sierra Nevadas, and then on to Mount Shasta which I summited

## Contact

If you'd like to get in touch with me, the best way is [good old fashioned
email](mailto:hifromyourblog@brenden.brndn.io).  I try to stay off the
advertising platforms. Although I may still have accounts on some of them, I
don't go there anymore.
