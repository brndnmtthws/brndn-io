--------------------------

I'm an entrepreneur, open source software developer, artist, and adventurer who's worked with a number of startups over the past 15 years. I've helped scale 3 separate $1B+ valuation companies through various stages of hypergrowth, and I've started a few companies of my own. I grew up in Canada, moved to San Francisco in 2009, and now I live in New York City. This page contains a non-exhaustive list of some things I've done.

These days I'm interested in building new companies. I'm very
interesting in finding ways to match talent with opportunity. Talent is
everywhere, but opportunity remains scarce for most.

## As a Professional

I've worked at a number of different startups including [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/), Mesosphere
(now known as [D2IQ](https://d2iq.com/)), [Braze](https://www.braze.com/), and others.

My first startup was a Canadian oil and gas company that manufactured instrumentation for oil and gas exploration. Specifically, we created tools for measuring pressure, temperature, and other metrics within oil and gas wells. The instrumentation was designed to withstand extremely high pressures, temperatures, and corrosive environments for months at a time.

In 2009 I joined a company in California that provided telecom companies with mobile network telemetry tools, and also offered network optimization services. There I created a custom database that was highly optimized for our workloads, built our own RPC system, and wrote the first parser for Ericsson LTE layer 2 network data. That company was later acquired by Tektronix (after I left).

In 2013 I joined Airbnb where I worked on the data infrastructure team. I contributed to a number of open source projects during that time, including the [Apache Mesos](https://mesos.apache.org/) project which I became a PMC member of. I also contributed to Chronos, SmartStack, Kafka, and other projects during my time at Airbnb.

In 2015 I joined Mesosphere to continue working with Mesos. Mesosphere was founded by 2 of my Airbnb teammates, as well as a Twitter employee (the creator of Mesos itself). I helped scale the company, build the sales team, and laid the foundation for the service organization.

In 2018 I joined Braze, but decided to leave after just 6 months to start a new company (which didn't work out in the end).

## Public Speaking

I've given talks at a number of different events including conferences, meetups, and private engagements. Some of the conferences I've spoken at in the past are [QCon](https://qconsf.com/), [All Things Open](https://allthingsopen.org/), MesosCon, ContainerCon, LinuxCon, and others.

## Open Source

I've contributed to a long list of open source projects over the years. I am probably most well known for creating a project called [Conky](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky). Today I have more than 100 public GitHub projects. Here are some of my more popular projects:

- [Conky](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky), a system monitor for X
- [optimal-buy-cbpro](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/optimal-buy-cbpro), a Coinbase Pro bot for dollar cost averaging
- [cracking-the-coding-interview-rust](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/cracking-the-coding-interview-rust), solutions to Cracking the Coding Interview problems written in Rust
- [The HODLer Manifesto](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/hodlermanifesto), a short manifesto on HODLing
- [tweet-delete](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/tweet-delete), a Twitter bot for deleting your tweets
- [mother-of-dragons](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/mother-of-dragons), a miner management tool for DragonMint/Innosilicon mining hardware
- [labhub](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/labhub), a bot for integrating GitLab CI with GitHub open source projects

## Adventures

I've climbed a few mountains, ran marathons, and done some long distance cycling ([randonneur style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randonneuring)). Here's a few examples:

- I biked from SF to NYC unassisted in 27 days. I recorded a [daily video log on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfHJt4o9-rmCH1J_DTVoNxrnJiaPUNg_O)
- I raced the Wolfpack Hustle Crash race before the 2012 LA marathon, crashed 1 mile before the finish line, and then ran the marathon in under 4 hours
- I biked to the summit of [Mauna Kea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauna_Kea), a volcano in Hawaii, unassisted. The climb to Mauna Kea's summit might be the longest continuous vertical climb in the world (from sea to summit is over 13,000ft in vertical gain)
- I biked from SF to Chico, through the northern Sierra Nevadas, and then on to Mount Shasta which I summited
