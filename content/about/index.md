I’m a driven entrepreneur, software engineer, and artist who loves partnering
with startups. Three have each exceeded a $1B valuation, and I’ve also launched
my own ventures.

Originally from Canada, I spent time in San Francisco and New York. This blog
blends personal journaling with tech insights. I’m always glad when readers find
something useful here.

My strengths revolve around learning quickly, problem-solving, and scaling.
Beyond work, I’ve explored mountains, run marathons, cycled long distances, and
kept a daily yoga routine.

Join me for discussions on entrepreneurship, software engineering, art, and
life.

## As a Professional

I’ve contributed to [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/), [Mesosphere
(D2IQ)](https://d2iq.com/), and [Braze](https://www.braze.com/). My path began
at a Canadian oil and gas company building instrumentation for exploration, then
shifted to mobile telecom optimization in California where I developed custom
databases, an RPC system, and built parsers for Ericsson LTE data before that
company was acquired.

At Airbnb, I focused on data infrastructure and open source contributions,
including Apache Mesos (where I became a PMC member), Chronos, SmartStack, and
Kafka. Later I helped scale Mesosphere, shaping its sales and services. After
Braze, I pursued entrepreneurship, wrote Rust programming books, and expanded my
startup experiences.

## Photography

I enjoy photography, particularly analogue photography (street, portraits, print
making), and images on this blog are free to use under [CC0
1.0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). [Here’s one
example](/posts/commercial-real-estate).

## Videography

I have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/aeouuuuuuuuuuuuuuu) and
used to [stream on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/letsmakestuff). My work once
appeared in a WeWork documentary on Hulu.

Some older videos are still up, though they can feel outdated. They remain
because some might still enjoy them.

## Adventures

I’ve tackled big challenges:

- Biked from SF to NYC unassisted in 27 days, recording a [daily YouTube vlog](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfHJt4o9-rmCH1J_DTVoNxrnJiaPUNg_O)
- Raced the Wolfpack Hustle Crash Race before the 2012 LA marathon, crashed, then still finished the marathon in under four hours
- Biked from sea level to Mauna Kea’s 13,000+ ft summit
- Rode from SF to Chico, then through the northern Sierra and up Mount Shasta
