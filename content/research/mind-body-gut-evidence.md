1. **Placebo Effect Studies**: Meta-analyses have consistently shown placebo effects across various conditions, with neuroimaging confirming measurable physiological changes. A 2020 review in Annual Review of Clinical Psychology documented that placebos activate endorphin release and specific brain regions[^1].

2. **Stress and Disease**: A 2018 meta-analysis in JAMA found chronic stress is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, with heightened inflammatory markers as a key mechanism[^2].

## Exercise and Brain Function

1. **Exercise and Neuroplasticity**: A 2019 review in Frontiers in Neuroscience demonstrated aerobic exercise increases BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), which promotes neurogenesis and synaptogenesis[^3].

2. **Exercise as Depression Treatment**: A 2016 meta-analysis in Journal of Psychiatric Research involving 1,487 participants found exercise comparable to antidepressants and psychotherapy for mild-to-moderate depression[^4].

## Gut-Brain Axis

1. **Enteric Nervous System**: The "second brain" contains 200-600 million neurons, independently regulating digestive functions while communicating bidirectionally with the CNS via the vagus nerve[^5].

2. **Vagus Nerve Communication**: A 2018 review in Frontiers in Psychiatry documented how the vagus nerve transmits about 80% of information from gut to brain, not brain to gut[^6].

3. **Microbiome Size**: The human gut hosts approximately 100 trillion microorganisms, outnumbering human cells 10:1, with collective genomes containing 150 times more genes than the human genome[^7].

## Microbiome and Mental Health

1. **Depression and Gut Bacteria**: A 2019 study in Nature Microbiology analyzed microbiome data from 1,054 people, finding depleted Coprococcus and Dialister bacteria in those with depression[^8].

2. **Probiotics and Anxiety**: A 2017 meta-analysis in PLoS ONE reviewing 10 clinical trials found probiotic supplements reduced anxiety symptoms compared to placebo[^9].

3. **Gut-Derived Neurotransmitters**: About 90% of serotonin and 50% of dopamine in the body are produced in the gut, directly influencing mood regulation[^10].

## Yoga Benefits

1. **Yoga and Stress Reduction**: A 2018 systematic review in the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine analyzing 42 studies found yoga significantly reduced cortisol levels compared to control activities[^11].

2. **Yoga and Brain Structure**: A 2015 neuroimaging study in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience found experienced yoga practitioners had greater gray matter volume in brain regions associated with body awareness, attention, and autonomic regulation[^12].

3. **Yoga and Inflammation**: A 2019 meta-analysis in the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine found consistent yoga practice reduced inflammatory markers including C-reactive protein, IL-6, and TNF-Î±[^13].
